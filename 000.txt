    Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up – the song
    “Moon Shadow” by Cat Stevens begins. Once we are high enough
    to see the entire moon, the main title is superimposed.

                   An American Werewolf in London

    We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it grows
    farther from us, continuing credits until the full moon is
    the size it appears to us from earth.

2   EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

    Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and
    we see a truck approaching. We are at a crossroads in the
    moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary
    reputation.

    The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER, mustached and
    wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down.

    “Moon Shadow” ends.

                                                      CUT TO:

    Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down.
    Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened young
    American boys. They look exhausted. They both carry
    backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe. They are
    both in their late twenties.

    It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too
    happily. Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch.

    JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

    They’ve been cramped for hours.

                          TRUCK DRIVER
                Here, lads, East Proctor and all

                    JACK
          Yes, well thank you very much for
          the ride, sir. You have lovely
          sheep.

                    TRUCK DRIVER
              (as he clambers back
              up on his truck)
          Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on
          the road. Good luck to you.

                    DAVID
          Thanks again!

He drives off. LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls
away. Surrounding them are the moors. They put on their
packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East
Proctor.

EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

As they walk, their breath visible:

                    JACK
          Are you cold?

                    DAVID
          Yes.

                    JACK
          Good.

They walk on, finally:

                    DAVID
          Jack.

                    JACK
          David.

                    DAVID
          You’re not having a good time are
          you?

                    JACK
          Oh, I don’t know. I mean look
          around. Isn’t this a fun place?

The camera shows us the moors – desolate, cold, foreboding.
                                               3.



                    DAVID
          Well, I like it here.

                    JACK
          I’m sorry. Northern England first,
          Italy later.

                    DAVID
          Right.

They walk on.

                    JACK
          Do you think she’ll meet me in
          Rome?

                    DAVID
          I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre
          person with a good body.

                    JACK
          Debbie is not mediocre and she has
          one of the great bodies of all
          time.

                    DAVID
          She’s a jerk.

                    JACK
          You’re talking about the woman I
          love.

                    DAVID
          I’m talking about a girl you want
          to fuck, so give me a break.

                    JACK
          Well, anyway, do you think she’ll
          be there?

                    DAVID
          I don’t know.

              kill you.

                        JACK
              I have to make love to her. It’s
              very simple. She has no choice
              really.

                        DAVID
              It just fascinates me that you can
              spend so much energy on someone so
              dull.

                        JACK
              It is impossible for a body like
              that to be dull.

                        DAVID
              We’ve known Debbie what, since the
              eighth grade? How many years of
              foreplay is that?

                        JACK
              She says she ‘likes me too much’.

    David just laughs and laughs and laughs.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

3   EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

    David and Jack entering East Proctor. It is brightly
    moonlit. East Proctor consists of a few shops, all closed, a
    petrol pump and a pub. East Proctor has a very small
    population and the place looks empty. David and Jack enter
    the middle of town and look about. The camera sees what they
    see. A few shops, dark and shuttered. Light and laughter
    come from the pub.
                                                               5.



4   EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

    Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf’s bloody head
    on a pike, and tells us the pub’s name, “The Slaughtered
    Lamb”.

                        JACK
              The Slaughtered Lamb?

                        DAVID
              Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.
              Why else would they have a severed
              fox head on a spear as their
              symbol?

                        JACK
              That’s a wolf’s head.

                        DAVID
              Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.
              Why else would they have a severed
              wolf’s head on a spear as their
              symbol?

                        JACK
              That’s not a spear.   It’s a pike.

                        DAVID
              A severed wolf’s head on a pike as
              their symbol.

                        JACK
              David, before we go in there I want
              you to know that – no matter what
              happens to us – it’s your fault.

                        DAVID
              I assume full responsibility.

                          JACK
              Okay.

                          DAVID
              Shall we?

5   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

    The pub was apparently “modernized” sometime in the mid-
    fifties.
                                                          6.


Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy stainless
steel and glass. It is populated by mostly pale young men
with longish hair. Several older men are ruddy complexioned
and sport large mustaches. Four or five are watching a chess
game. Two men are playing darts. The conversation is loud
and there is often laughter. But there is something unsavory
about these people. A look of leanness and poverty. They
seem inbred and somehow sullen. We establish the types and
the general level of noise in the room.

The door opens revealing David and Jack. There is dead
silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two
boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention.
They give each other a “what?” look, then turn to the
assembled populace.

                      DAVID
          Hello.

                    JACK
          Nice to see you.

FACES

Silent and staring.

                                                    CUT TO:

DAVID AND JACK

                    DAVID
              (smiles)
          It’s very cold outside.   May we
          come in?

The WOMAN BARKEEP nods. The boys walk    carefully over to a
table and very self-consciously remove   their packs, place
them on the floor, and sit down at the   table. There is a
long, awkward wait. The Woman finally    comes over to them.

                    JACK
          Do you have any hot soup?

                      WOMAN
          No.

                    DAVID
          Well, do you have any coffee?
                                                        7.



                    WOMAN
          No.

                    JACK
          Hot chocolate?

                    WOMAN
          We’ve got spirits and beer. If
          it’s something hot you want, you
          can have tea.

                    JACK
          Then you have some hot tea?

                    WOMAN
          No.

                    JACK
          Oh.

                    WOMAN
          But I can heat some up for you if
          you’d like.

                    DAVID & JACK
          Yes, please.

As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes what
they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess and darts,
and the boys breathe easier.

                    JACK
          Nice looking group.

                    DAVID
          Listen, at least it’s warm in here.

                    JACK
          Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

JACK’S P.O.V.

On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed star)
and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                    DAVID
          What about it?
                                                           8.



                    JACK
          It’s a five-pointed star.

                    DAVID
          Maybe the owners are from Texas.

The Woman brings them their tea.

                    JACK
              (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                    WOMAN
          I beg your pardon?

                    DAVID
          He was joking. Thank you.

                    WOMAN
          Joking? I remember The Alamo. I
          saw it once in London, in Leicester
          Square.

Jack and David look startled.   One of the CHESS PLAYERS
explains:

          She means in the cinema, that film

                    DAVID
          Oh, yes, of course.

          Right, with Laurence Harvey and
          everybody died in it. It was very
          bloody.

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Bloody awful if you ask me!

This sends everyone into gales of laughter.    Jack and David
smile politely.

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear
          the one about the crashing plane?
                                                  9.



                      WOMAN
            No, but we’re about to.

Laughter.

                      CHESS PLAYER
            You be quiet, woman, and let me
            speak.

                      WOMAN
                (heavy sarcasm)
            Quiet, everyone! Hush!    Shhh!

Uproarious laughter.

                      CHESS PLAYER
            All right, laugh then. I shan’t
            tell it.

                      WOMAN
            Oh, come on, tell us.

                       CHESS PLAYER
            No.   You’ve had your chance.

The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                      JACK
                (to David)
            Ask them what the candles are for.

                      DAVID
                (to Jack)
            You ask them.

                      JACK
                (to David)
            Listen, that’s a pentangle, a five-
            pointed star. It’s used in
            witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and
            Universal Studios maintain it’s the
            mark of the wolf man.

                      DAVID
                (to Jack)
            I see. You want me to ask these
            people if they’re burning candles
            to ward off monsters.
                                                       10.



                    JACK
              (to David)
          Right.

                    DAVID
              (to Jack)
          Wrong.

The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as
everyone knew he would.

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Oh, all right. There was this
          airplane over the Atlantic on its
          way to New York. It was full of
          men from the United Nations.

                    WOMAN
          That’s very funny, that is.

Uproarious laughter.

                    JACK
              (to David)
          Go on, ask them.

                    DAVID
              (to Jack)
          You ask them.

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Here now, let me finish! So
          halfway over the ocean the engines
          run low on petrol so they have to
          lighten the plane. So they heave
          out all the baggage, but it’s still
          too heavy. So they chuck out the
          seats, but it’s still too heavy!
          Finally this Froggy steps up and
          shouts “Viva la France” and leaps
          out. Then an Englishman....

                     DART PLAYERS
          Hear!   Hear!

                    CHESS PLAYER
              (undaunted)
          ...steps up and shouts ‘God save
          the Queen!’ and leaps out.
                    (MORE)
                                                       11.
                    CHESS PLAYER (CONT'D)
          But the plane is still too heavy.
          So the Yank delegate from Texas
          steps up, shouts, ‘Remember the
          Alamo!’ and chucks out the Mexican.

This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of East
Proctor have ever heard. The laughter is uproarious,
choking, knee-slapping, incredible. As the Chess Player goes
to take a drink of beer, the Dart Player gasps out...

                    DART PLAYER
          Remember the Alamo!

...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer causing even
harder laughter. Complete hilarity.

                    JACK
          Excuse me, but what’s that star on
          the wall for?

Dead silence. A dart lands in the wall. David and Jack are
understandably bewildered. The villagers look hard indeed.

                    DART PLAYER
              (angry)
          You’ve made me miss.

                       JACK
          I’m sorry.

                    DART PLAYER
          I’ve never missed the board before.

                    DAVID
          Jack, we’d better go.

                    JACK
          What do you mean?   I’m starving.

                    DART PLAYER
          There’s no food here.

The villagers look threatening and David’s voice is a bit
urgent.

                    DAVID
          Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                    JACK
          Apparently so.
                                                           12.



    The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the
    door.

                        WOMAN
                  (to men)
              You can’t let them go.

                        DAVID
                  (worried)
              How much do we owe you?

                        CHESS PLAYER
              Nothing, lads. Go, God be with
              you.

                        DAVID
              Uh, thank you.

                          WOMAN
              Wait!    You just can’t let them go!

                        DART PLAYER
              Go! And stay on the road.    Keep
              clear of the moors.

                        DAVID
              Yes, well, thanks again.

                        CHESS PLAYER
              Beware the moon, lads!

    David pushes Jack out.

6   EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

    It is very cold.

                        JACK
              What the hell was that all about?

                        DAVID
              I don’t know. Let’s see if there’s
              an inn or something up the road.

                        JACK
              Beware the moon?

                        DAVID
              Come on, I’m freezing.
                                                             13.



    They start up the road into the night.

7   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

    It is quiet.

                        WOMAN
              You can’t let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                  (angry)
              Should the world know our
              business?!

                        CHESS PLAYER
              It’s murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
              Then murder it is! It’s in God’s
              hands now.

    The wax drips from the Pentangle’s candles onto the floor.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

8   EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

    walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                        DAVID
              That was weird. I guess leaving
              was the best idea.

                        JACK
              I don’t know. Now that we’re out
              here and it’s three degrees, I’m
              not so sure I wouldn’t rather face
              a blood-thirsty mob.

                        DAVID
              Well, not quite a blood-thirsty
              mob.

    They keep walking.

                        JACK
              What do you think was wrong?

                        DAVID
              I have no idea.
                                                                14.



                          JACK
                Maybe that pentangle was for
                something supernatural.

                          DAVID
                I see and they were too embarrassed
                to talk about it, because they felt
                so silly.

    There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
    illuminating sheet of light over the boys’ faces. The clap
    of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                          DAVID
                Please don’t rain.

    Downpour.   The boys are walking in a deluge.

                             DAVID
                Of course.

    They walk getting soaked.

                          JACK
                Say, David....

                          DAVID
                I’m well aware of how pleasant the
                weather is in Rome at the present
                time thank you.

    Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                          JACK
                Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

    The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the windows. The
    gathered continue to drink, play chess and darts, but all are
    silent and contemplative.

                          WOMAN
                Perhaps they’ll be safe in the
                rain.

    The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.     Shouts:
                                                            15.



                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!    No one
               wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft? What do you think
               they’d say? They’d think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.   There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?   We must go to
               them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player’s hard face shows the
     man’s struggle. Another howl. The Chess Player turns
     suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East
     Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet. There is a light
     drizzle. They are standing, listening. The drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.
                                                       16.



                      JACK
          Yeah?

                      DAVID
          A coyote.

                    JACK
          There aren’t any coyotes in
          England.

                    DAVID
          The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                    JACK
          Pecos Bill.

                    DAVID
          Heathcliffe.

                    JACK
          Heathcliffe didn’t howl.

                    DAVID
          No, but he was on the moors.

                    JACK
          It’s a full moon, ‘beware the
          moon’.

Another howl, this one long and loud. It is a very inhuman
noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                    JACK
          I vote we go back to The
          Slaughtered Lamb.

                      DAVID
          Yeah.

They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from
where they just came. Although after a bit of fast walking
they are getting nowhere. They stop out of breath.

                    DAVID
          We’re lost.

Another bloodcurdling howl.

                     JACK
          Shit!   David, what is that?
                                                       17.



                    DAVID
          I don’t know. Come on.

                    JACK
          Come on, where?

                    DAVID
          Anywhere! I think we should just
          keep moving.

A growl. A low guttural growl comes from out of the
darkness. We stay on the boys, but we hear something out
there. It starts to walk.

                    DAVID
          It’s moving.

                    JACK
          It’s circling us.

And indeed it is. The boys strain to hear its four footfalls
and they turn slowly, following it. A snarl.

                    JACK
          Fuck.

We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that’s what it is – we
know it’s there even though we’ve not seen it). It sits
breathing heavily.

                    DAVID
          What’s the plan?

                    JACK
              (nervously)
          Plan?

                    DAVID
              (not too relaxed
              himself)
          Let’s just keep walking.

They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                    DAVID
          That’s right, a lovely stroll in
          the moors. Tra-la-la, isn’t this
          fun?
                                                           18.



The thing stalking them seems to speed up.     The boys hesitate
as they sense it run past them. It stops.

                    DAVID
          It’s in front of us.

                    JACK
          Do you think it’s a dog?

Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

BOYS’ P.O.V.

Something is waiting in the darkness. Its hulking shape is
barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath
is visible.

                     JACK
          Oh shit.   What is that?

                    DAVID
          A sheep dog or something. Turn
          slowly and let’s walk away.

The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                    JACK
          Nice doggie. Good boy.

                    DAVID
          Walk away, Jack.

                    JACK
          Walking away, yes, sir.    Here we
          are walking away.

They are in a full-out run by now.   After a few minutes
flight they stop, panting.

                    DAVID
          See anything?

                     JACK
          No.

A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                    DAVID
          It sounds far away.
                                                           19.



                    JACK
          Not far enough.      Come on.

They walk briskly.

                       DAVID
          Jack?

                       JACK
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          Where are we going?

                    JACK
          I’ll tell you when we get there.

                     DAVID
          Well.   I’m glad we...WHOAA!!

David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring Jack,
and us, and himself a great deal. He lays startled on the
wet ground for a moment, then he and Jack laugh.

                    JACK
          You really scared me, you shithead.

                    DAVID
          Are you going to help me up?

Jack takes David’s extended hand to help him up when THE WOLF
MONSTER SPRINGS!

EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop. David
falls back on his ass. Jack is screaming and struggling as
he is torn to shreds. David scrambles to his feet and runs
in complete panic. Jack’s screams and the wolf’s roars
combine.

                    JACK
          Jesus fuck! David! Please help
          me! Please! David! Shit! Help
          me! Oh God!

EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

David runs and runs.    Finally he falls, out of breath.
                                                            20.



                           DAVID
               Jack?    Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess
     on the ground. He stares in horror.

                           DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS! The camera adopts David’s P.O.V. as he
     fights the dark savage shape on top of him. Fangs clamp down
     on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form
     rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from The
     Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running
     towards him. Looking over at his attacker, instead of a wolf
     he sees a very old, naked man laying in the mud riddled with
     bullet holes. As the villagers crowd around, David falls
     back and faints.

                                                      FADE OUT

     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital room. He
     lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm
     plugged into a bottle of plasma. There are several cuts and
     abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn’t look
     too bad. He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit
     up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain. He
     calls out....

                           DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out. However his shout has fetched a nurse.
     She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very beautiful. She goes to
     the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?
                                                          21.



She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and
then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                    ALEX
          Mr. Kessler?

David remains unconscious.    Another young nurse, MISS
GALLAGHER, comes in.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          He all right?

                    ALEX
          Yes, I should think.    He called out
          just now.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          He’s an American, you know. Dr.
          Hirsch is going to fetch round one
          of those Embassy fellows to see
          him.

                    ALEX
          Chart says he’s from New York.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          I think he’s a Jew.

                    ALEX
          Why on earth do you say that?

                      MISS GALLAGHER
          I looked.

                    ALEX
              (smiles)
          Really, Susan, I don’t think that
          was very proper, and besides, it’s
          common practice now.

A voice startles the girls.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is
          quite right.

DR. HIRSCH enters. He is an older man wearing the customary
lab coat. A very commanding and reassuring presence. The
girls are embarrassed.
                                                        22.



                    ALEX
          Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a
          minute ago.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Miss Gallagher, surely you must
          perform some function here at the
          hospital.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Yes, Doctor.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Then get on with it.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Yes, Doctor.

She exits. Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.   Alex
watches. Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Can I be of service, Miss Price?

                    ALEX
          Dr. Hirsch?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Go about your duties.

                    ALEX
          Yes, Doctor.

She starts to exit.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Oh, Miss Price?

                    ALEX
          Yes, Doctor?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          What exactly did he call out?

                    ALEX
          He said ‘Jack’.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          That would be Jack Goodman, the boy
          who was killed.
                                                            23.



                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an escaped
               lunatic attacked them. He must
               have been a very powerful man.
               Although I really don’t see that it
               is any of your concern, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir. Of course, sir.   Good
               day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination, looking
     into David’s eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the almost
     dense greenery. On the soundtrack are the footfalls and
     heavy breathing of the runner. The camera abruptly stops and
     turns, sharply looking about, the panting continuing. The
     breathing gets louder and harder, then too loud when we:

                                                       CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy. Standing beside
     the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS. Mr. Collins wears a
     bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and
               this is a countryman of yours, Mr.
               Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You’re in a hospital in London.

                         DAVID
               London? Where’s Jack?    I had a
               strange dream.
                                                24.



                    DR. HIRSCH
          I should think so after your recent
          traumatic experiences.

                    DAVID
          The guy I was with. Is he all
          right? How did I get to London?

                    DR. HIRSCH
              (quietly)
          Now, David, I want you to prepare
          yourself; your friend is dead.

David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                      DAVID
          What?

The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                      DAVID
          Ow, shit!

He sinks back down.

                    DAVID
          Jack’s dead?

                    MR. COLLINS
          Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins of
          the American Embassy here in
          Grosvenor Square. Both Mr.
          Goodman’s parents and your parents
          have been notified of your injuries
          and everything’s in order.

                    DAVID
          Everything’s in order?    What are
          you talking about?

                    MR. COLLINS
          Mr. Goodman’s body has been air-
          freighted back to New York for
          burial and your parents have wired
          funds for your stay in the hospital
          until you are well enough to fly
          home.
                                                       25.



                    DAVID
              (controlled tears)
          You don’t crate and ship Jack like
          some side of beef.
              (approaching hysteria)
          Who the hell are you people?
          What’s going on here? Where is
          Jack? I demand to see him!

                    DR. HIRSCH
              (holds David down,
              calls out)
          Miss Price! Miss Price, please!

                    DAVID
              (shouting)
          Get your fucking hands off me!
          What the hell is going on here?

Alex enters amidst David’s shouting and confusion.

                    MR. COLLINS
              (distraught, clutching
              his briefcase)
          I realize how upsetting this must
          be for you, Mr. Kessler, but please
          try to refrain from hysterics.

David continues shouting and struggling.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss
          Price.

The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr. Hirsch
and Alex until his breathing becomes more normal.

                    MR. COLLINS
          Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to excite
          yourself. Everything has been
          arranged. I shall come back to
          check on your progress and send a
          report to your parents. The police
          have requested to interview you and
          I have given them permission to do
          so.

Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.
                                                           26.



                    DR. HIRSCH
          Thank you very much, Mr. Collins.
          He’ll rest now and I’m sure
          everything will be fine once he’s
          adjusted. He’s had quite a shock.

                    MR. COLLINS
          These dumb-ass kids never
          appreciate anything you do for
          them.

Mr. Collins exits.   Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                    DAVID
          How long have I been here?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          You’ve been unconscious since you
          were brought in two weeks ago.

                       DAVID
          Two weeks?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          You’ve suffered some rather severe
          cuts and bruises, lost a bit of
          blood, but nothing too serious;
          black and blue for a while. You’ll
          have some dueling scars to boast
          of. That lunatic must have been a
          very fierce fellow. They say a mad
          man has the strength of ten.

                    DAVID
              (softly, as the drugs
              take hold)
          Lunatic?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Now we’ve just given you a pretty
          strong sedative, so try to get some
          rest now. Miss Price will see to
          your needs. Rest now.

Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David’s covers.

                    DAVID
              (softly)
          It wasn’t a lunatic.
                                                              27.



                         ALEX
                   (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                   (bends down close
                   to hear)
               What?

                          DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.   Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly boring.
               Yes, dear, but couldn’t we...I see.
                   (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger. Yes, I’m sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I’ll survive another
               excruciating evening with Roger
               Mathison. Be a good girl. Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.     The intercom buzzes.

                          DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are
               here to see you, Doctor.
                                                       28.



                    DR. HIRSCH
          Send them in.

He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall, the
other rather pudgy.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          Dr. Hirsch?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Come in, come in. Please sit.
          Some tea?

The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a small
notebook.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          No, thank you.

                    SGT. McMANUS
          I’d like some tea, please.

Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                       SGT. McMANUS
          Maybe not.     No thanks. Maybe
          later.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          It’s no problem.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          No, thank you, Doctor.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Well, then, what can I do for
          Scotland Yard?

                    SGT. McMANUS
          We understand the Kessler boy has
          regained consciousness.

Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                       SGT. McMANUS
          Sorry.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          Has Mr. Kessler said anything
          regarding the attack on the moors?
                                                            29.



     The intercom buzzes.

                            DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.     Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                            DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He’s on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I’m out. No, tell him
               I’ve passed away. An old war wound
               or something. Tell him I’m dead.
               And no more calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to say
               concerning the attack on the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don’t we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed. Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus stand by
     his side. Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I’m sorry if I conflict with your
               report, but Jack and I were not
               attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you’ve said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point, Lieutenant.
               Two strong boys would be able to
               defend themselves against one man.
                                                        30.



                    LT. VILLIERS
          Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting
          that David and Jack were, in fact,
          attacked by some animal and that
          the officialdom of East Proctor has
          conspired to keep it a secret? We
          have an autopsy report on the
          murderer who was shot in the act by
          the local police. We have two
          witnesses to the crime. You’ll
          forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I
          consider your testimony as coming
          from someone who has gone through a
          terrible shock.

                    SGT. McMANUS
          Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty
          lucid to me and....

                    LT. VILLIERS
          And what, Sergeant?

                    SGT. McMANUS
              (defeated)
          I don’t rightly know, sir.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          That is precisely my point. David,
          as far as we are concerned, the
          matter is closed. We won’t trouble
          you any further. Good day.

The lieutenant goes for the door.   The sergeant smiles at
David and follows.

                     LT. VILLIERS
          Doctor.

The cops exit.   Dr. Hirsch crosses to David’s bed.

                    DAVID
          There were witnesses?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          So they said.

                    DAVID
          How could there have been
          witnesses? It was so dark.
                    (MORE)
                                                               31.
                         DAVID (CONT'D)
               We were running and I fell and Jack
               went to help me up and this thing
               came from nowhere...I don’t
               understand what they’re talking
               about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I’m sure it will all come
               back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine. It’s my
               sanity I’m beginning to worry
               about.

                                                       CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through the
     woods. Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing
     through the foliage. The camera runs for a while then
     suddenly stops short near a tree. David abruptly enters
     frame, animal-like, the tenseness of a startled cat. His
     head makes sudden movements, looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him. He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps. We run with him
     faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration. We see him
     completely as the animal, study his movement and grace as if
     watching a gazelle. Suddenly he stops again, alert,
     listening. He moves with stealth, slowly he pushes some
     leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.
                                                            32.



     DAVID’S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and freeze,
     the camera noting a fawn next to a doe. The buck turns his
     head, feeling the danger.

                                                       CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David’s eyes.

     CLOSEUP

     of the frightened deer.

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of David’s eyes.

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame as
     David forces it down. David’s head reenters frame, his mouth
     full of flesh, his face and hands covered with blood. He
     howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David’s asleep. The door opens, a
     shaft of light penetrates the room. Miss Gallagher enters
     with a small tray. She crosses to David, turns on the bed
     light and touches him.

                          MISS GALLAGHER
                Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.

                          DAVID
                    (awakened)
                I was having a nightmare.
                                                       33.



Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the pills
and pouring a glass of water.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Yes, well these should help that.
          That’s right, drink up.

David takes the pills.

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Now go back to sleep so you’ll be
          fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
          morning.

                    DAVID
          What time is it?

                     MISS GALLAGHER
          It’s nearly eight. I’m off duty
          shortly, then I’m off to the films
          with Alex.

                    DAVID
          Alex?

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Miss Price, the other nurse that
          attended you.

                    DAVID
          What are you going to see?

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          An American film about the Mafia
          called ‘See You Next Wednesday’,
          and I want to see it badly, so you
          give me no problems and go to
          sleep.

                    DAVID
              (dropping off)
          Do you have bad dreams, too?

                    MISS GALLAGHER
          Some, everyone does.

                    DAVID
          Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
                                                            34.



                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep. Miss Gallagher turns off the light,
     picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES’ STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys about,
     doctors, visitors, and patients all performing appropriate
     background actions. Behind the Nurses’ Counter, Alex is
     typing some forms and an older, obviously senior nurse is
     filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of
     pills she is taking from the drug cabinet. She is MRS.
     HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please? The American boy in twenty-
               one is only to have these after
               he’s eaten. Will you be sure of
               that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as that,
               Miss Price. He just doesn’t eat
               enough of what is put before him.
               He suffers from nightmares. I’d
               think he just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
                                                             35.



     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way down the
     hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her appearance. She
     enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.   She
     goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                          ALEX
               No what?

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that way.
               Here, swallow this.

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin who
     promptly takes it and then drinks the water, handing Alex
     back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round later.
               Would you like a picture book to
               look at? We have some lovely funny
               Beanos.

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                          ALEX
               Right.
                                                             36.



     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black Jamaican
     ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into Benjamin’s ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American? Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, ‘how did he
               look’?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem depressed?
               Do you think he’ll eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                   (annoyed)
               I’m an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist! I push things about,
               but I’ve little say what happens to
               them.

                            ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David’s room.   She
     hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David’s lunch waits patiently on
     its tray alongside of the bed. David is apparently asleep.
     Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                   (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                            DAVID
                      (lifeless)
               Yes?
                                                   37.



                    ALEX
          You haven’t eaten your lunch.

                    DAVID
          I’m not very hungry, thank you.

                     ALEX
          I’m afraid you have to eat
          something.

                    DAVID
          Please, really. I’m not hungry.

                    ALEX
          You put me in an awkward position,
          Mr. Kessler.

                    DAVID
          How is that?

                    ALEX
              (she shakes the paper cup)
          Well, you’re to take these after
          you’ve eaten. Now what kind of
          nurse would I be if I failed in so
          simple a task as giving out some
          pills?

                    DAVID
          Leave the pills.    I’ll take them
          later.

                    ALEX
          Sorry.

She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                    DAVID
          Aw come on, Miss Price!

                    ALEX
          Call me Alex.

                    DAVID
          Aw come on, Alex!

                    ALEX
          Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr.
          Kessler?
                                                       38.



David is getting interested.

                    DAVID
          Call me David.

                    ALEX
          Shall I be forced to feed you,
          David?

                    DAVID
          This is absurd. I’m not hungry.    I
          don’t want any food.

                    ALEX
          Right.

Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits
on the edge of the bed. Taking knife and fork in hand, she
neatly cuts David’s food into pieces. David watches all this
amused. She places a napkin under David’s chin and holds up
his first bite on his fork. David folds his arms and refuses
to open his mouth.

                    ALEX
          Let’s try a little harder, shall
          we?

                    DAVID
          Will you give me a break?

Alex grabs David’s nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
shoving the fork in it. David is startled, but amused and
chews his food slowly and swallows it. Alex holds up another
bite.

                    ALEX
          Will I have to take such drastic
          action again, David?

David opens his mouth obediently. Alex almost smiles. She
feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each other up.
Finally:

                    DAVID
          May I have a glass of milk?

Alex smiles.

                                                 FADE OUT
                                                              39.



     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster. David again running
     naked, flying through the green forest. He stops suddenly,
     ears perked, he looks about and then we hear Jack’s o.s.
     screams. The voice of Jack screams:

                        JACK (O.S.)
               David! David! Please help me!     Oh
               God! David! Oh my God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with him)
     desperately trying to find the source of Jack’s screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming through
     the tall trees. Jack’s screams halt in mid-word. David
     looks in disbelief at the clearing. There is a hospital bed
     with someone in it. It is the same as David’s.

     David walks toward it slowly. The figure in the bed lays
     still. It grows dark, very dark, and David looks up at the
     full moon. There is a howl identical to the one heard
     earlier back on the moors. David approaches the bed slowly,
     fearfully. We hear ocean noises on the soundtrack, the sound
     of crashing surf. David reaches out to pull back the covers,
     lightning and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second.
     Silence. The camera remains on David as he pulls off the
     covers. His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find – DAVID.   He lies there, pale white
     with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David’s terrified face; then
     continue until David’s death mask fills the screen. The face
     remains still for several beats, then suddenly opens its
     bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a
     bloodcurdling wail which carries over in the....

                                                        CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES’ STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David’s screams and efficiently calls
     out....
                                                               40.



                              MRS. HOBBS
                  Orderly!    Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                            MRS. HOBBS
                  Orderly, go at once to twenty-one
                  and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                            MRS. HOBBS
                  Miss Gallagher, remain here at the
                  desk. I’ll be in twenty-one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes thoughtfully out
     the window.

                            DR. HIRSCH
                  You’ve never had bad dreams before?

                            DAVID
                      (upset)
                  Sure, as a kid. But never so real.
                  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                            DR. HIRSCH
                  Did you get a good look at the man
                  who attacked you?

                            DAVID
                  I’ve told you, it wasn’t a man.   It
                  was an animal. A big wolf or
                  something. A rabid dog.

                               DR. HIRSCH
                         (chewing on his glasses)
                  Yes.

                            DAVID
                  Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I’ve been
                  traumatized, but Jack was torn
                  apart. I saw him.
                            (MORE)
                                      41.
          DAVID (CONT'D)
A man can’t do that to someone with
his bare hands.

          DR. HIRSCH
You’d be surprised what horrors a
man is capable of.

          DAVID
Did you see Jack?

          DR. HIRSCH
No. In fact, your wounds were
cleaned and dressed before you
arrived here.

          DAVID
Did you talk to the police in East
Proctor? Did the cops go to The
Slaughtered Lamb?

          DR. HIRSCH
I really don’t know.

           DAVID
Then why the hell are you so quick
to disbelieve me? You yourself
said it must have taken incredible
strength to tear apart a person
like that.

          DR. HIRSCH
    (rubs his forehead)
David, please. The police are
satisfied. I’m certain that if a
monster were out roaming northern
England we’d have seen it on the
telly.

          DAVID
You really think I’m crazy, don’t
you?

          DR. HIRSCH
Believe me. The Hound of the
Baskervilles was an invention of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s. And if
you’d read the bloody book, you’d
find that Holmes discovered your
house of hell a fraud, a fake.
                                                              42.



     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr. Hirsch is
     embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David. You’re far too
               intelligent to go on this way.
               When you return to America I want
               you to seek out a competent
               psychiatrist or psychologist or
               something and stop this nonsense.
               You’ll be leaving this hospital in
               three or four days, please remain
               sane. At least until you are no
               longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                   (pause)
               I’d rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.   I’ll fetch
               in young Miss Price.

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David’s bed. Her shoes are off and she has
     her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair. The room is
     dark except for the lamp by which she reads. She is reading
     A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court by Mark Twain.
     David is asleep. Alex reads for a bit, then puts down the
     book and yawns. She gets up and stretches, a big spreading
     arms and feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                   (quietly)
               You’re a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                   (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                          DAVID
               I was.   What are you reading?
                                                      43.



                    ALEX
          ‘A Connecticut Yankee in King
          Arthur’s Court’ by Mark Twain.

                    DAVID
          Do you like it?

                    ALEX
          I’ve just started it.    My friend
          gave it to me.

They look at each other.

                    ALEX
          What do you dream about?

                    DAVID
          I dream of death mostly.

                       ALEX
          I’m sorry.     I shouldn’t have asked
          you.

                       DAVID
          It’s okay.     I want to talk to you.

They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                    DAVID
          How old are you?

                    ALEX
          That’s not really a very proper
          question.

                    DAVID
          How old are you?

                    ALEX
          Twenty-eight.

                    DAVID
          I’m twenty-seven.

                         DAVID

               My best friend. My very best
               friend.

                          DAVID
               What?   Oh, yes, please.

                   (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It
               was in Warwick Castle that I came
               across the curious stranger whom I
               am going to talk about. He
               attracted me by three things: his
               candid simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient armor, and
               the restfulness of his company –
               for he did all the talking. We
               fell together as modest people will
               in the tail of the herd....

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David’s parents’ house in New York. His FATHER
     sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger
     BROTHER and SISTER watch “The Muppet Show” on television.
                                                              45.


     We can see past the small dining nook where David   sits doing
     homework and into the kitchen where his MOTHER is   washing the
     dishes. A peaceful lower, middle class setting.     All is
     tranquil and secure. There is a loud pounding on    the front
     door.

                         FATHER
               I’ll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!   Hold your
               horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.) When he opens
     the door, four beings open fire with machine guns, blowing
     him away. The sudden burst of violence is terrifying and
     unrelenting. The four rush into the room and the family
     looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not
     human at all, but loathsome, bestial demons dressed as Storm
     Troopers. One kicks in the television and fires into the
     kitchen, blasting David’s mother. David rises but is forced
     back into his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream
     in terror before they are brutally murdered. The monstrous
     Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms. The one holding
     David pulls a knife and quickly slits David’s throat.

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings. He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee folded on
     her lap. He makes a deliberate effort to calm himself. He
     considers waking her, then decides against it. He turns on
     the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from
     Alex’s lap. David takes the book as gently as possible, but
     Alex wakes up anyway.

                         ALEX
                   (yawns, smiles)
               Hello. You all right?
                                      46.



          DAVID
I’m sorry I woke you up.

           ALEX
Don’t be silly.   Can I get you
something?

          DAVID
No, thank you. Just keep me
company for a while.

          ALEX
That’s easy enough.

          DAVID
I keep having these really terrible
dreams. They are getting worse and
I can’t seem to stop them.

           ALEX
David, your dreams will stop.
You’ll leave England and your bad
memories; and then this will all
fade away.

          DAVID
Will you come with me?

          ALEX
    (taken aback)
What?

          DAVID
    (smiling)
I’m serious. You don’t know me and
I know nothing about you. We have
a perfect relationship.

          ALEX
Now, David, I said I would keep you
company, but I meant right here and
now.

          DAVID
Will you think about it?

          How did we get from your bad dreams
          to my taking a holiday with a
          patient?

                    DAVID
              (big grin)
          Not just a patient –- me.

                    ALEX
          You’re being awfully forward,
          aren’t you?

                    DAVID
          Forgive me, I’m trying to cheer
          myself up and an affair with a
          beautiful nurse seemed like just
          the thing to do it.

                    ALEX
              (smiles)
          All I am to you is a sex fantasy
          then?

                    DAVID
          Now I’m embarrassed.

                    ALEX
          Good. I thought for a moment I was
          the only embarrassed one in the
          room.

There is an awkward pause.

                    DAVID
          Where were we in the book?

Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                    ALEX
              (looking through
              the book)
          Let me see here.

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David’s breakfast tray,
     busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed. He
     awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you’re up. Good morning and a
               good day to you. We’ve quite a
               meal for you here this morning.
               Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and
               toast with jam. Good stuff there.
               Now eat it up and I’ll be back for
               the dishes when you’ve finished.

     The Orderly exits. The drowsy David, who has been trying to
     fully wake up during the Orderly’s speech, notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily. He sticks a spoon
     into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                   (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast
     and drink his juice. While he eats, we hear Jack’s o.s.
     voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack. Jack, behaving relaxed
     and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex.
     However, Jack’s appearance makes his casual manner all the
     more surreal. He is as we left him butchered on the moors.
     He is covered with dried mud and open wounds. Huge
     glistening gashes abound on his body. His face is scratched,
     his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood.
     In several spots he has already begun to rot. He is a
     remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not
     to affect him at all.

                         JACK
                   (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.
                                                       49.



                    DAVID
              (unbelieving)
          Get the fuck out of here, Jack.

                    JACK
          Thanks a lot.

                    DAVID
              (horrified)
          This is too much.   I can’t handle
          this.

                     JACK
          I’m aware that I don’t look so
          great, but I thought you’d be glad
          to see me.

Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David’s tray as
David watches amazed. Jack returns to his seat and takes a
bite out of his toast. David stares at Jack horrified.

                     JACK
          David!   You’re hurting my feelings.

                    DAVID
              (astounded)
          Hurting your feelings? Has it
          occurred to you that it may be
          unsettling to have you rise from
          your grave to visit me? Listen to
          me, I’m talking to a hamburger!

                    JACK
          I’m sorry to be upsetting you,
          David, but I had to come.

                    DAVID
              (aghast)
          Aren’t you supposed to be buried in
          New York someplace?

                    JACK
          Yeah. Your parents came to my
          funeral. I was surprised at how
          many people came.
                                                50.



                    DAVID
              (resigned)
          Why should you be surprised? You
          were a very well-liked person.

                    JACK
          Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                    DAVID
          I can’t stand it.

                    JACK
          So you know what she does? She’s
          so grief stricken she runs to find
          solace in Rudy Levine’s bed.

                    DAVID
          Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                    JACK
          Life mocks me even in death.

Jack takes another bite of toast.

                    DAVID
              (to himself)
          I’m going completely crazy.

                       JACK
              (loud)
          David!

                    DAVID
              (louder)
          What?!

                    JACK
          David, now I know this may be hard
          for you, but I have to warn you.

                    DAVID
              (shouting)
          Warn me? Will you get out of here,
          you meat loaf?

                    JACK
          I’m a grisly sight, it’s true; but
          I love you and that’s why I’m here.
          You’ve got to know.
                                                51.



                    DAVID
          If you love me so much, Jack,
          you’ll realize how disconcerting it
          is to share one’s breakfast with
          the living dead!

                    JACK
          We were attacked by a werewolf.

                    DAVID
              (covers his ears)
          I’m not listening!

                    JACK
          On the moors, we were attacked by a
          lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                    DAVID
          Shut up, you zombie!

                    JACK
          I was murdered, an unnatural death,
          and now I walk the earth in limbo
          until the werewolf’s curse is
          lifted.

                    DAVID
              (incredulous, furious)
          What’s wrong with you? Shut up!

                    JACK
          The wolf’s bloodline must be
          severed. The last remaining
          werewolf must be destroyed.

                    DAVID
          Will you be quiet?!

Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                    JACK
          It’s you, David.

                    DAVID
          What?!

                    JACK
          You survived and now you shall
          continue the curse.
                                     52.



          DAVID
What are you talking about? I
won’t accept this! Get out! God
damit!

          JACK
Remember what that guy at The
Slaughtered Lamb said? ‘Beware the
moon.’

          DAVID
    (quietly)
Stop it, Jack.

          JACK
Beware the moon. The full moon,
David. You’ve got two days.

          DAVID
    (quietly)
Jack, please go away.   Please go
away.

          JACK
You’ll stalk the streets of London
a creature of the night.

          DAVID
    (flares up)
You’re talking like Boris Karloff!
It’s movie dialogue!

          JACK
David, please believe me. You will
kill people, David. You’ve got to
stop the bloodshed before it
begins.

          DAVID
    (yells)
Nurse!

          JACK
Listen to me! Take your own life,
David. It’s our only chance.

          DAVID
Nurse!
                                                          53.



                         JACK
               The supernatural! The powers of
               darkness! It’s all true. Take
               your own life! Suicide, David.
               Join me.

                         DAVID
                   (losing it)
               Nurse! Oh God! Alex!

                         JACK
               It’s cold, David, and I’m so alone.
               The undead surround me. Have you
               ever talked to a corpse? It’s
               boring! I’m lonely! Kill
               yourself, David, before you kill
               others.

ALEX

as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

DAVID

laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly. He
is alone. Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the
bed and hugs David.

                     ALEX
          David?   David!

David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly until
he focuses on Alex’s face and begins to breathe easier.

                    ALEX
          David, what’s wrong?

David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                    DAVID
              (quietly)
          I’m a werewolf.

                    ALEX
          A werewolf?

Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and
backs off a little. David composes himself.

                    ALEX
          Are you better now?

                    DAVID
          I’ll let you know the next full
          moon.

                    ALEX
          You’re to be discharged tomorrow.
          Will you be all right?

David takes Alex’s hand.

                    DAVID
          My friend Jack was just here.
                                                            55.



                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah. He says that I will become a
               monster in two days. What do you
               think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think? You mean about
               the possibility of your becoming a
               monster in two days or about visits
               from dead friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                   (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?

35   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     David and Alex walking down the street. Alex points out her
     flat and leads David up the front steps. She gives him a
     conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.

36   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - DAY

     Alex enters and David follows. A small, utilitarian
     apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light. David puts his
     backpack on the floor.

                         ALEX
               The kitchen.

                            DAVID
               Very nice.

               Lovely.

               The bedroom.

                         DAVID
               There is only one bed.

                         ALEX
                   (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you’d like to watch
               the telly while I take a shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking on
     his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream of
     water in the shower.

                         DAVID
               It’s nice to see you.

                         ALEX
               It’s nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh. Van Morrison’s “Moondance”
     plays. A montage of soapy hands on slippery skin. Thighs
     rubbing thighs, arms and shoulders. David and Alex kiss
     again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex’s bed.
     David pulls out and they lay holding each other. After a
     moment....

                            DAVID
               Alex?

                            ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about fifteen
               minutes?

                            ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                   (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don’t honestly believe
               that in reality your friend Jack
               rose from the grave to breakfast
               with you? Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                            DAVID
                   (firm)
               I wasn’t hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                   (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That’s good, Alex.   Reassure me.
                                                            58.



     Alex begins kissing David’s neck.

                         DAVID
               It’s all right, I know I’m being
               insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                          DAVID
               Okay, okay. I’m properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually lowers
     from frame. David reaches back over his head to hold onto
     the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                   (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.   I’m
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David. David carefully lifts her arm
     and gets out of bed. He is naked. He tiptoes out of the
     room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees. He winces, hoping the
     steady stream doesn’t awaken Alex. When he’s finished peeing
     he goes to the sink. The medicine cabinet door over the sink
     is open. When David closes it he (and the audience) is
     terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him. (Note:
     This is a big scare.) Bloodied and horrible, Jack has
     continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw
     him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them. Jack is still there in the
     mirror. When David turns around Jack is standing in the
     doorway.

                         DAVID
                   (points a trembling
                   finger)
               You’re not real.
                                                            59.



                         JACK
               Don’t be an asshole, David.   Come
               here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living room.

40   INT. ALEX’S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also. He does.
     David’s conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up
     Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you’ve seen me.    Now go away.

                         JACK
               David, I’m sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must understand
               what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right. You’re one
               of the undead and I’m a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                          JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the full
               moon. You’ll change, you’ll
               become....

                         DAVID
                   (interrupting)
               A monster. I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life now,
               David, before it’s too late.
                                                     60.



                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                          DAVID
               I think I’ve lost my mind. I think
               you’re not real. I think I’m
               asleep and you’re a part of another
               bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack? That tomorrow night
               beneath the full moon I’ll sprout
               hair and fangs and eat people?
               Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real. You’ll
               taste real blood! God damit,
               David, please believe me! You’ll
               kill and make others like me! I’m
               not having a nice time, David!
               Don’t allow this to happen again!
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
                   (shouts)
               I will not accept this!   Now go
               away!

41   INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                   (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.
                                                                61.



                         DAVID
                   (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what’s wrong?    I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                   (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.     It was just
               me.

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last. The
     Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the Chess
     Player is still at the chessboard. Dr. Hirsch enters and
     crosses to the bar. As he removes his gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there. What can I get you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will suffice.

     She serves him his beer.    As he lays down his money...
                                                       62.



                    DR. HIRSCH
          A thousand thanks.

After a few sips.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Nasty bit of business with those
          two young American boys.

The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                     DART PLAYER
          I’m afraid I don’t know what you
          mean, sir.

                     DR. HIRSCH
          Yes, I’m sure that’s right. A few
          weeks ago, the last full moon
          wasn’t it?

The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look at Dr.
Hirsch.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          I mean that escaped lunatic. The
          one that killed the boy. Wasn’t
          that near here?

                    CHESS PLAYER
              (concerned)
          And where are you from, sir?

Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his table.

                     DR. HIRSCH
          London.   Knight takes pawn.

                     CHESS PLAYER
          What?

Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Oh, yes, yes.

Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          What’s that?
                                                    63.



                    WOMAN
              (nervously)
          Oh, that’s been there for two
          hundred years. We were going to
          paint it out, but it’s traditional,
          so we left it.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          I see. You’ve heard nothing about
          the incident?

                      DART PLAYER
          Incident?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          The murder?

                    CHESS PLAYER
          Are you a police officer?

                    DR. HIRSCH
              (smiles)
          No, no, hardly. I work in the
          hospital where the Kessler boy was
          brought.

The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          He was talking about werewolves and
          monsters and as I was near here I
          thought....

                    DART PLAYER
          You thought what?

                    DR. HIRSCH
          I thought I’d look into the boy’s
          story.

                    CHESS PLAYER
              (scoffs)
          A story about werewolves – now
          really, sir.

Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                    DR. HIRSCH
          Would you like a game of chess?
                                                            64.



45   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door. Alex
     is dressed in her nurse’s uniform and David has jeans and a T-
     shirt on. He is shoeless and obviously not going out. Alex
     pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you’ll make me late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                           ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it’s silly of me to be
               apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It’s silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not exist.

                         ALEX
                   (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay here
               tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.    It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too anxious,
               call me at the hospital, okay?

                           DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I’ve left those pills for you.
                                                           65.



                    DAVID
          A doper werewolf.

They kiss again.

                     ALEX
          I’m off.   There’s food in the
          fridge.

                    DAVID
          See you later.

Alex goes off, turning for a last wave. David stands looking
after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog passes by. The
dog, on seeing David, begins to growl and snarl.

                    DAVID
              (to dog)
          What did I do?

The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl tugging
on his leash.

                    DAVID
          Thanks a lot, dog.

He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back up the
steps to find the door locked.

                       DAVID
          Wonderful.

Cut to shot of David’s bare feet on the cold stone.   He
mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                    DAVID
          An American werewolf was found
          frozen to death today in the heart
          of London, England.

He looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar on
the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground, which
can be reached by climbing a brick wall, which he does but
not without damage to his bare toes.

At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing
David. The hair stands up on its arched back and it glares
at David, hissing and spitting. David is disturbed by the
cat’s hostile behavior.
                                                              66.



                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce. When David goes to pat it
     cautiously, it screeches and runs away. David is, by this
     time, not amused. David manages to pull himself into the
     window.

47   INT. ALEX’S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny window.
     Finally getting both feet on the ground, he steps to the sink
     and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                   (weakly)
               Snarl. Growl. Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.   After
     a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX’S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.   He closes
     the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed. After a few beats of staring at the
     ceiling, he rises and goes back into the kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX’S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I’m not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX’S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television. On Thames is a soccer match.
     On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children’s program, and on BBC
     2 is a soccer match. David switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers and
     humming.
                                                            67.



                         DAVID
                   (singing)
               ‘Moon River, wider than a mile
               I’m crossing you in style,
               Someday....’

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it open.
     It is getting dark. David views this fearfully, but still
     not completely convinced. He goes back inside and we note
     that the front door is not completely closed. He goes back
     into the bathroom and looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of
               an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and round
     the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                          ALEX
               No what?

                          BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                   (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face and
               neck?

                          BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.
                                                               68.



                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                          BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles. As Alex tucks him in,
     we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window.

53   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                   (screams)
               What? Christ! What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of his
     head. He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I’m burning up! Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.    His body is dripping
     wet.

                         DAVID
                   (shouts out in
                   pain and fear)
               Jack!? Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                          DAVID
               Help me!   Somebody help me, please!
               Jack!!

     David’s hair is wringing wet.   He screams and grabs at his
     legs.
                                                            69.



                         DAVID
                   (pleading, whimpering)
               I’m sorry I called you a meat loaf,
               Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David’s body. He
     grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning
     him.

     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for
     air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He
     remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment;
     but it’s no use. On all fours he gives himself over to the
     excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one. As
     bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers
     lacerating pain. We can actually see David’s flesh move, the
     rearranging tissue. His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge. His
     whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally
     changing shape before our eyes. His hands gnarl and his
     fingers curl back as claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the
     window. David’s moans change slowly into low guttural
     growls. We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to
     walk. As the camera pans back over the room, we see the
     front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the
     darkness.

54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats. An attractive
     couple gets out. The Man pays the driver and the cab drives
     off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let’s go
               ‘round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?
                                                            70.



                         MAN
               Come on, we’ll give Sean a scare.

                         WOMAN
               You’re crazy, Harry.

                           HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the
     flats. The apartments back up to a park and the two walk
     around to the rear. The park is dark and quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                           HARRY
               Just now?

                           WOMAN
               Yes.

                        HARRY
               No. Here we are, Sean’s is the
               one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS! Before the Woman can scream, the Wolf
     whirls around and goes for her throat. We can’t see clearly,
     but we see enough to realize how large the Wolf is and that
     its wolfen features are twisted and demonic. The Wolf
     savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN’S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean’s wife is looking through their French windows out onto
     the park – a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in the
               park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren’t you ready yet?   They’ll be
               here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something’s going on out there.
                                                            71.



57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES’ STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense medication into
     paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches. He is still wearing
     his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if Miss
               Price has seen the Kessler boy
               since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don’t know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

                         ALEX
               It’s all right, Susan.    Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently follows Dr.
     Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife’s complaints. She hangs by the door. He walks deeper
     into the park.

                         SEAN
                   (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.
                                                                 72.



     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.    Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of her
     concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your extracurricular
               activities are of no consequence to
               me. I don’t give a damn who you
               sleep with. I’m concerned about
               David.

                            ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It’s a full moon. Where is he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat. I’m off at midnight
               and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex. Your number!

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees. He steps
     on something and looks down to see what it is. It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.   (This is a scare.)   It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He’s not there.

     Alex grows worried.
                                      73.



            ALEX
He’s not?

          DR. HIRSCH
Alex, has David persisted in his
werewolf fantasies?

          ALEX
Well, yes, but he seems to be more
upset by the death of his friend.

          DR. HIRSCH
Has his friend appeared to him
again?

            ALEX
Yes.

          DR. HIRSCH
What did he say?

          ALEX
David says Jack comes to warn him.

            DR. HIRSCH
Warn him?

          ALEX
Dr. Hirsch, what’s wrong?   Is this
more serious than I know?

          DR. HIRSCH
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records. The case was
closed and now they’ve ‘misplaced’
the file. David’s lacerations were
cleaned and dressed when he arrived
here and yet supposedly no doctor
examined him before I did. The
Goodman boy is already in the
ground so he’s no good to us. So I
went to the pub in East Proctor
where I was convinced of two
things.

            ALEX
Yes.
                                                  74.



                      DR. HIRSCH
            They were lying. There were no
            witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The
            whole community is hiding the truth
            of what actually happened up there.

                      ALEX
            And what else?

                      DR. HIRSCH
            I think the village of East Proctor
            is hiding some dark and terrible
            secret. I’m convinced that, like
            David, they believe in this
            werewolf.

Alex is flabbergasted.

                      DR. HIRSCH
            You’ve absolutely no idea where
            David might be?

                       ALEX
            No. He knows no one in London,
            besides me. I shouldn’t have left
            him alone.

Suddenly.

                      ALEX
            Surely you’re not suggesting....

                       DR. HIRSCH
            David has suffered a severe trauma.
            I myself witnessed some form of
            mass neurosis in East Proctor. If
            all the villagers believe that Jack
            Goodman was killed by a werewolf,
            why shouldn’t David? And then it
            follows that if he survived an
            attack by a werewolf, wouldn’t he
            himself become a werewolf the next
            full moon?

                      ALEX
                (bewildered)
            Dr. Hirsch?
                                                             75.



                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don’t mean running about on
               all fours and howling at the moon.
               But in such a deranged state he
               could harm himself, or perhaps
               others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let’s call the police and see if
               they can help us find our wandering
               boy.

63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London are
     stark and uninviting in the moonlight. Three old DERELICTS
     are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm. A
     skinny dog is tied up beside them. Its ears perk up and he
     growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                   (calls out)
               Who’s there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let ‘im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                   (worried)
               Here – who’s there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.   We’ve heard this sound
     on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That’s not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night. They strain their eyes –
     something is approaching them. They can just make out its
     size.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt. (A scare.) We are in the tubes
     of London. Only one passenger disembarks and the train goes
     off, leaving him alone in the cavernous hallways. The
     PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-dressed. He looks
     about the platform, then at his watch. He walks up to a
     vending machine to buy a Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar. He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something. Satisfied
     that he is alone, he begins his walk down one of the long
     serpentine tunnels that make up London’s tubes. He feels
     he’s being followed and turns slowly to look. There is no
     one and he continues, concerned about his imagination.

CLOSEUP - WOLF’S SNOUT

In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and black
tongue. It waits, panting, drool falls from its mouth.

BACK TO SCENE

The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly down the
long tunnel marked “Escalator to Street Level”. He is being
followed. He hears it and we hear it. He stops, frightened.

                       PASSENGER

          Is there someone there?

We hear the Wolf’s heavy breathing.   The Passenger is
beginning to panic.

                    PASSENGER
          I can assure you that this is not
          in the least bit amusing!

He looks around wildly.

                    PASSENGER
          I shall report this!

PASSENGER’S P.O.V.

We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the tunnel
towards us.

          Good Lord.

turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.   He is terrified.

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying his
     nose. He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear. Reaching
     the escalator, he begins to run up the moving stairs, falling
     several times. He sits, panting and defeated, the blood
     trickling from his nose.

65   CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING

     (A scare.)    The tiger paces in its cage and roars again.    We
     are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused. We cut
     around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and panicky
     birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves’ cage where we find
     David, naked and curled up on the ground by the cage, asleep.
     David wakes up slowly. He is completely naked, his body
     dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs. He
     yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth. He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them,
     he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he
     is. He puts his hands over his eyes.

                            DAVID
                  Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he’s still there.   He
     stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about.
     David sees them coming towards him, notes his lack of
     clothes, and decides it would be better for all concerned if
     they did not meet. He looks around for a suitable hiding
     place and dashes behind some bushes. He crouches down so
     that he can’t be seen, scratching himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David’s torn T-shirt. She is trying to
     read her book, but is just too distracted. The phone rings
     and she runs for it.

                   (excited, then
                   disappointed)
               Hello? No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn’t
               come back yet. Yes, I will,
               doctor, but I just feel so helpless
               sitting here doing nothing. Thank
               you, yes, goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.   She is now
     more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes. He looks to see if the
     coast is clear, then stands up and parts the bushes. He
     steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is staring
intently at the gorilla. The Little Boy leaves the monkey
house and we travel with him as he looks at several other
animals. Eventually he comes to the Wolf cage.

                       DAVID (O.S.)
             Pssst!

The Little Boy looks around.

                       DAVID (O.S.)
             Hey, kid! Pssst. Little boy with
             the balloons.

The Little Boy pantomimes, “who me?”

David cannot be seen.

             If you come over here, I’ll give
             you a pound.

The Little Boy shakes his head.       The bush pleads.

                       DAVID (O.S.)
             Two pounds?

The Little Boy shakes his head.       The bush reasons:

                       DAVID (O.S.)
             Listen, two pounds is a lot of
             money. It’s almost five dollars.

                       LITTLE BOY
                 (very English)
             I don’t know who you are.

                   (losing patience)
               Come here and I’ll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery, but
     stops a few feet away.

                   (pleading)

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                            DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his balloons,
     startling several animal lovers.

               I’ll have one of those, too.

     He pays for the papers. The second one’s headline, “Death

     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus. When the bus
     pulls up, they all crowd in. The camera goes to floor level
     and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus.
     Passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly
     pans on their galoshes, boots, high heels, rubbers, etc.,
     until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet.
     We pan up to find David clad only in a woman’s rain coat with
     a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible. A man
     looks at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                   (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we’ve been having
               lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX’S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading. There is
     loud knocking on the door. Alex rushes to open it and David
     enters quickly, closing the door behind him. He is still
     wearing the woman’s coat.

                        ALEX
               David! Where on earth have you

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and gets
     dressed as Alex watches in amazement. David is excited, even
     euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I’ve lost my mind. I woke up
               at the zoo! But you know what? I
               feel terrific!

                          ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that’s not so
               insane. Having no clothes on?
               That’s insane. What did I do last
               night, Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don’t you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you. I was
               locked out of the flat. I climbed
               the wall and came in through the
               bathroom window. I started to read
               and then I was naked at the zoo!
                   (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.     We didn’t
               know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back with
     equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

73   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE

     Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone.
                                                            84.



74   INT. ALEX’S FLAT

     The phone rings.

                         ALEX
               I’ll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

                            ALEX
               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and Dr.
     Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won’t hear her.

                            ALEX
               He’s here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                   (excited)
               Is he all right? Why didn’t you
               call me? Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn’t remember.   He woke up at
               the zoo.

                          DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?   Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is. He’s very excited and
               confused, but he’s not crazy, if
               that’s what you mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers today?
               Have you listened to the radio or
               television?

                            ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?
                                                            85.



                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right. Now listen carefully. I
               want you to bring David here. I
               want him in my care. I’ll notify
               the police that we’ve found him.
               It is imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital. Do you
               understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You’re certain he’s lucid?    You
               won’t need any help?

                            ALEX
               He’s fine.     We’ll come right over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then dials
     again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?

75   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     Alex and David are walking.
                                                       86.



                         ALEX
               The next corner we can get a cab.

                         DAVID
                   (grins)
               I should be committed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.

                         DAVID
                   (stretches)
               I don’t know why I feel so good.    I
               haven’t felt this good in a long
               time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.   I feel
               like an athlete.

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

                         ALEX
               Get in.

76   INT. TAXI - DAY

                         ALEX
               Saint Martin’s Hospital.

                         DRIVER
               Right.

     As they drive.

                         DRIVER
               It’s like the days of the Mad
               Barber of Fleet Street, isn’t it?

                         ALEX
               I beg your pardon?

                         DRIVER
               The murders.

                         DAVID
                   (concerned)
               What murders?
                                                            87.



                         DRIVER
               Last night. Haven’t you heard?
               Six people in different parts of
               the city mutilated. A real maniac
               this one.

                            DAVID
               Pull over.

                            ALEX
               But....

                          DAVID
                   (adamant)
               Pull over.

77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off after
     David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?   It had to be
               me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops. There’s a
               full moon tonight. Jack was right.
               I....
                                                        88.



                    ALEX
              (angry)
          Jack is dead!

                    DAVID
          Jack is dead. Look, six people
          have been killed. I’m going to the
          police.

David takes off walking briskly down the street.   Alex has to
jog to keep up with him.

                    ALEX
          David, please be rational.   Let’s
          go to Dr. Hirsch.

                    DAVID
          Rational!?! I’m a fucking
          werewolf, for Christ’s sake!

He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                    DAVID
          Officer, I killed those people last
          night.

                    BOBBIE
              (interested)
          You did, did you?

Alex runs up.

                    ALEX
          He’s playing a stupid joke, sir.

                    DAVID
              (dumbfounded)
          What?

                    ALEX
          We had an argument.   He’s being
          silly.

                    DAVID
              (desperate)
          I swear, I don’t know this girl.

                    BOBBIE
          All right, you two, move along.
                                                       89.



                     DAVID
          Hey, you asshole!   I want you to
          arrest me!

                    BOBBIE
          There’s no call for that kind of
          language.

                    DAVID
              (shouts)
          Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince
          Charles is a faggot! Winston
          Churchill was full of shit!

                    BOBBIE
              (losing patience)
          Now see here young man.

                    DAVID
          Shakespeare was French! The Queen
          Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit!
          Fuck! Piss!

The Bobbie takes David’s arm roughly as pedestrians start to
gather.

                    BOBBIE
          That’s quite enough!

                    ALEX
              (pleading)
          David, please!

                    DAVID
          Who is this girl?

                    BOBBIE
          You’re going to have to stop this
          disturbance or I shall arrest you.

                    DAVID
              (frustrated, yelling)
          That’s what I want you to do, you
          moron!

                    ALEX
              (to Bobbie)
          Sir, he’s very upset.   His friend
          was killed and....
                                                    90.



                    DAVID
          Will you shut up!?!!

                    BOBBIE
              (losing his temper)
          That’s enough! Now go about your
          business.

                    ALEX
          Yes, David, let’s go.

                    DAVID
              (disbelief)
          You’re not going to arrest me?

David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                    DAVID
          Don’t you think he should arrest
          me?

                    ONLOOKER
          Well, I’m not sure. How does he
          know this isn’t a prank?

                    DAVID
              (despair)
          A prank?

                    ALEX
              (urgently)
          David....

The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                    BOBBIE
          I’ve no time for this foolishness.
              (to onlookers)
          Nothing to look at. Move along.

The Bobbie walks away.   David is beside himself.

                    DAVID
          Hopeless. It’s hopeless.

                    ALEX
              (softly)
          David, let’s go now.

David turns in a rage.
                                                             91.



                          DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit! You people
               are crazy! I’ve got to get away
               from here! I’ve got to do
               something!

                         ALEX
                   (worried)
               David, don’t lose control.

                         DAVID
                   (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?! What control!?!    Get
               away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.   Cars slam on their brakes, just
     missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It’s too late. He’s lost in traffic.    Alex stands for a
     moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic. He finally comes to rest in an
     alley. He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.   Dr.
     Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel that
               some sort of animal was involved,
               that’s true, but I hardly think....
                                               92.



                    DR. HIRSCH
              (interrupts)
          Regardless of what you think,
          Lieutenant, the fact remains that
          David is missing and that we must
          find him.

                    SGT. McMANUS
          Before nightfall.

                       DR. HIRSCH
          Precisely.

                    LT. VILLIERS
              (harried)
          Gentlemen, please. We shall find
          Mr. Kessler as quickly as we’re
          able.

                    ALEX
          He tried to have himself arrested.
          He....

                    LT. VILLIERS
              (interrupts)
          Getting arrested isn’t all that
          difficult, Miss Price.

                    ALEX
          He wants help. He....

                    DR. HIRSCH
              (interrupts)
          What can we do to assist you?

                    LT. VILLIERS
              (rising)
          Stay here. If we need you, we’ll
          know where to reach you.

He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                    LT. VILLIERS
          I cannot accept a connection
          between David Kessler and last
          night’s murders. We will find him,
          however. I can assure you of that.
                                                             93.



                         SGT. McMANUS
               We’ll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.   Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                   (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                   (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator. I’d like to call
               the United States and reverse the
               charges. David Kessler for anyone.
               Yes, I’ll wait. Hello? Yes, area
               code 315/472-3402. Thank you.
                   (pause)
               Hello? Rachel? Just say yes,
               you’ll accept the charges. Just
               say yes, Rachel. Is Mom or Dad
               home? Where are they? Where’s
               Max? You’re all alone? Mom and
               Dad wouldn’t leave me alone when I
               was ten. No, not ten and a half
               either. I’m still in London. I’m
               all better. Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them? I
               don’t care, Rachel, just do it for
               me. Okay? Good. And, Rachel,
               don’t fight with Max. Well, try.
               Look, kid, please don’t forget to
               tell Mom and Dad I love them. I
               love Max and you, too. Well, I do.
               No, I’m not being weird, you little
               creep. You promise? Okay. Be a
               good girl. I love you. Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.   Leaving the booth he
     sees an outdoor clock. It is 4:15.    He sighs, then catches
     sight of something.
                                                                   94.



81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID’S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly. He’s pretty
     much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the
     grinning skull. He waves to David. Jack points inside the
     theater and goes in. David smiles, walks across the
     intersection, and up to the box office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.      All he has are traveler’s
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler’s check?

                            TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.       David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen. The small theater
     is mostly empty. A few snoring BUMS and wide-eyed CHILDREN
     are scattered about. Jack sits in the last row in the
     shadows. He waves to David. David goes and sits next to
     him.

                            DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                            JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?
                                                       95.



                    JACK
          You don’t have to say anything.

                    DAVID
          Aren’t you going to say, ‘I told
          you so’?

                    JACK
          If I was still alive, I probably
          would.

                    DAVID
          You look awful.

                       JACK
          Thank you.

                    DAVID
              (apologizes quickly)
          I didn’t mean it. I don’t know
          what I’m saying. I’m not even sure
          it was me who killed those people.
          I don’t remember doing it.

                    JACK
          What about the zoo?

                    DAVID
          Well, even if I’m not the wolfman,
          I am crazy enough to do something
          like that. I mean, here I sit in
          Leicester Square talking to a
          corpse. I’m glad to see you, Jack.

                    JACK
          I want you to meet some people.

Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD BRINGSLY,
completely in the shadow.

                    JACK
          David Kessler, this is Gerald
          Bringsly.

                       DAVID
          Hello.
                                                       96.



                    JACK
          Gerald is the man you murdered in
          the subway. We thought it best you
          didn’t see him as he’s a fresh kill
          and still pretty messy.

                    BRINGSLY
              (in shadow; very English)
          Yes, I do look most unpleasant.

The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from the seat
to a puddle on the floor.

                    DAVID
              (horrified)
          Why are you doing this to me, Jack?

                    BRINGSLY
          This isn’t Mr. Goodman’s idea. He
          is your good friend, whereas I am a
          victim of your carnivorous lunar
          activities.

                     DAVID
               (appalled)
          Mr. Bringsly, I’m sorry. I have
          absolutely no idea what to say to
          you.

                    BRINGSLY
          You’ve left my wife a widow and my
          children fatherless. And I
          understand that I am to walk the
          earth one of the living dead until
          the wolf’s bloodline is severed and
          the curse lifted.

Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he glistens.

                    BRINGSLY
          You must die, David Kessler.

                    JACK
          David, this is Harry Berman and his
          fiancee Judith Browns.

The two victims lean forward from their seats next to Mr.
Bringsly. We can just make out that Harry has one arm
missing.
                                                       97.



                    JACK
          And these gentlemen are Alf, Ted,
          and Joseph.

The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith. All are
slick in the darkness, the light from the screen illuminating
their gore.

                    DERELICT #2
          Can’t say we’re pleased to meet
          you, Mr. Kessler.

                    DAVID
              (defeated)
          What shall I do?

                     JACK
          Suicide.

                    HARRY
              (adamantly)
          You must take your own life!

                    DAVID
          That’s easy for you to say – you’re
          already dead.

                    BRINGSLY
          No, David. Harry and I and
          everyone you murder are not dead.
          The undead.

                    DAVID
              (to Jack)
          Why are you doing this to me?

                    JACK
          Because this must be stopped.

                    DAVID
          How shall I do it?

                    JUDITH
          Sleeping pills?

                    DERELICT #1
          Not sure enough.
                                               98.



                    DAVID
          I could hang myself.

                    JACK
          If you did it wrong, it would be
          painful. You’d choke to death.

                     DERELICT #3
          So what?   Let ‘im choke.

                    JACK
          Do you mind? The man’s a friend of
          mine.

                    DERELICT #3
          Well he ain’t no friend of mine.

                    BRINGSLY
          Gentlemen, please.

                     HARRY
          A gun.

                    DERELICT #1
          I know where he can get a gun.

                     DAVID
          Don’t I need a silver bullet or
          something?

                    JACK
          Be serious, would you?

David puts his head in his hands.

                     DAVID
          Madness.   I’ve gone totally mad.

                    HARRY
          A gun is good.

                    JUDITH
          You just put the gun to your
          forehead and pull the trigger.

                    BRINGSLY
          If you put it in your mouth, then
          you’d be sure not to miss.
                                                              99.



                         DAVID
               Thank you, you’re all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the
     grisly tableau. David grabs his head suddenly.

                                                         CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.   The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently. Three small
     children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him.

                         DAVID
                   (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away! Please! Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David’s seizures grow more
     severe.

                         DAVID
                   (his face contorting)
               Run! Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair. Coarse thick hair
     splits his skin. The children’s eyes widen in fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.    The TICKET
     TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:

                         TICKET TAKER
               I’ll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater. The movie continues on
     screen, but all else is quiet. He cautiously continues down
     the aisle. He sees something and makes his way towards it.
     He looks down in horror.
                                                             100.



     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                        CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and single out
     TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema through the busy
     traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It’s horrible, horrible! There’s a
               beast! A mad dog! It’s killing
               people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied corpses.
     He hears something, looks over to see the Wolf hunched over a
     victim. The Wolf turns, eyes blazing, mouth dripping with
     blood. We see it clearly for the first time. It is truly a
     hound from hell, its wolfen features a hideous sight. Its
     eyes fierce, burning green. The Wolf roars and starts for
     the cop. The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God’s sake, Tom, there’s a
               monster in there!

     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them down.
     The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell them
               to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.   The door is bulging.   The
     Wolf’s roars continue.
                                                           101.



                         COP #2
               Keep moving! Will you people get
               out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH’S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.    Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there’s a
               disturbance in Leicester Square
               involving some sort of mad dog.

                           ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it. But it’s something to
               do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are distributed to
     uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring. Officers are pushing the
     crowd back as other men help hold the door closed against the
     Wolf’s battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers and
     Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on here?

                         COP
               It’s some kind of animal, sir.
               We....

     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the Wolf,
     eyes blazing. It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging him. The
     crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid hitting it
     and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling one through a shop
     window. Mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police
     pursue the Wolf.
                                                              102.



     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac. It stops in the
     darkness, blocked by a brick wall. The Wolf whirls around,
     defiant, roaring. The cops quickly barricade the entrance to
     the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester Square.
     Police vehicles roar past.

                            ALEX
               David!     It’s David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.

95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley. Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley. The officers
     shout after her. Dr. Hirsch reaches the police line.

                            DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                            ALEX
               David?     Is it you?    Is it true,
               David?

     She’s almost to the end. The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows. The police raise their weapons.

                            ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.    In that brief instant, Alex realizes it
     will kill her.
                                                      103.



                    OFFICER
          Fire!

The guns blaze. The Wolf falls dead. Alex leans on the
wall, numb. The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus run to
the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and riddled with
bullets. Alex begins to weep.

FADE IN:


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm late summer air.

SOUND: Crickets.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:


EXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT

CREDITS BEGIN.

A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is
ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino
pants. He is drinking beer.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses
it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.

ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox
on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He
shines it on the switch.

He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a
pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also
gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back
pocket.

ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT

He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the
light on the switch for a moment. During this:

		ARNIE (sings)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat, won't you try, won't you
	buy Rheingold beer...

He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.

		ARNIE
	Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!

He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and
drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then
he picks up his crowbar.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -
something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is
a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes
still hang from it.

What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as
wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we
should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick
ourselves for not knowing earlier.

It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on
the whole rail-rider.

CREDITS CONCLUDE.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as
hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly,
both the tracks and the switch move.

		ARNIE
	Hot damn! Now... a little oil...

He turns back toward the rail-rider.


EXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

		ARNIE
	It's not bitter, not sweet... it's
	a big fuckin' treat...

A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling.
ARNIE looks around.


EXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of
his tools.


EXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching
point.


EXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT

A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws
on that hand.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT

Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is
still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow.
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy
Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.


EXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the
long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving
the can.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...

He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.


EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of
course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,
half wolf, half human.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see
what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is
in extremely deep shit.

SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF  NIGHT

It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow
green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of
horror.

		ARNIE
	Oh n-

A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is
granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his
body.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand
reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.
The hand is dripping blood.

It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.

The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible
grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.

		WEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the
bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams
out.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW  NIGHT

He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth
and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU  NIGHT

The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins
to eat the bottle.

Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in
pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.

Looks up. It HOWLS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS  NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might
be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be
1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time
moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and
forth. No one is in a hurry.

We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);
Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett
neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see
the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.
We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia
Loren in "Two Women."
It's Our Town, U.S.A.

		JANE (voice-over)
	This place is Tarker's Mills, where I
	grew up... and this is how it was when I
	was fourteen - a place where people cared
	about each other as much as they cared
	about themselves. This is how my town
	looked as, all unknowing, it approached the
	rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.

SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.


EXT./INT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a
car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.
b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.
They both look around.
c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at
the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.


EXT.  THE SETTING MOON, CU  NIGHT

As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.

		JANE (v-o)
	The killing had begun, but at first no
	one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic
	drunk, and what happened seemed like an
	accident.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY  NIGHT

Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO
DAWN.

SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.

CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There
is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of
ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.

SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.

		JANE (v-o)
	The county coroner concluded that Arnie
	passed out on the tracks. There wasn't
	enough evidence to conclude anything else.

And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn
blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears
underneath. We see something flopping and moving under
there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON  DAY

The common is more or less in the center of town, either
surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on
the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but
the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE
TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!

Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been
set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked
breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit
down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are
tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.

		JOE HALLER (amplified voice)
	I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,
	of Holy Family Catholic Church!

Enthusiastic applause greets this.


INT.  THE CROWD  DAY

Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're
looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her
husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It
is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard
speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has
been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she
leans toward her mother.

		JANE
	I'm going out for a while, 'kay?

		NAN
	All right. Stay close. And make sure your
	brother's all right.

As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.

NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue
to wear it through the whole movie.


INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY

To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.
It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency
medical unit.

Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in
one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and
beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning
to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the
applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years...

No amplification. He taps the mike.


INT.  JANE

She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people
should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of
about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.

		GIRL (mocking)
	"Make sure your brother's all right."

		JANE (low)
	Marty's a booger.

She reaches the aisle and starts out.


INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE

He taps the mike again.


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW

		BOB (good-natured)
	Just pretend you're in your own church
	askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!

Good-natured laughter greets this.


INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM

A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF
SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years, I have had a
	dream. A dream of a time when modern
	medical care would come to this small
	community, which sometimes seems so far
	from Durham, with her lifesaving
	hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at
	which I see so many of my friends
	gathered, will be the start of making my
	dream come true.

SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.


EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU

It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling
through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF
APPLAUSE.

		MARTY (voice)
	Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're
	not poisonous?

		BRADY (voice)
	Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -
grab the blacksnake.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU

BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with
respectful wonder.

NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,
and will through the whole movie.

		MARTY
	Lemme hold him!

BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY
sees:


EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY

		JANE (v-o)
	I was almost fifteen that summer. My
	brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his
	friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I
	had to bear. Brady was actually the worse
	of the two, but I was rarely disposed to
	see that. Not when my younger brother was
	so constantly thrown in my face by my
	parents.

		LOWE (v-o from the tent)
	$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you
	think of the lives this unit might save, it
	seems very inexpensive indeed.

Applause greets this.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from
waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.

		BRADY
	I got an idea.

		MARTY
	What?

BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes
widen.

		MARTY
	You wouldn't.

BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.

		MARTY
	You would.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE

		LOWE
	An endeavor like this seems to me to be
	the very definition of community - all
	of us pulling together as one, farmers
	and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...


EXT.  JANE

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing
under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.

		BRADY (teasing voice)
	Jane... Jane...

She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost
touching her upturned face.

JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over
her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a
nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose
shredded at the knees.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing
wildly.


EXT.  JANE

She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's
near tears.


EXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT

The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part
of this little stunt, as he ought to be.

		MARTY
	It was just a blacksnake, Jane-


EXT.  JANE

She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and
something very close to hate.

		JANE
	Look at my knees! Look at my dress!
	I hate you!


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her
	teddies?


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Stop it, Brady.


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

He throws the snake.


EXT.  JANE

She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning
to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.


EXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Ooooh, naughty!


EXT.  MARTY

He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural
in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for
the time being we must be puzzled.

		MARTY
	Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We
	didn't mean-

He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.

		JANE
	Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,
	you booger!

She runs away.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He swings down and comes over to MARTY.

		BRADY (with satisfaction)
	Really got her goat that time.


EXT.  MARTY

He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.

		MARTY
	Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.


EXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY

She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she
steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt
of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.

		STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)
	Wait! Don't go!

Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress
down. No one in sight.

		MAN (voice; rough)
	Just leave me alone!

Now she looks toward:


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV

A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who
has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about
the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the
bandstand.

STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to
the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -
but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara
Falls.

		STELLA (calls)
	Please! You have to help me!


EXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER

		DECEIVER (keeps walking)
	It's your oven, but it ain't my bun
	you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.

B.g. SOUNDS: More applause.


EXT.  JANE

We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the
bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.
JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in
this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the
stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose
absently in a litter can.

JANE mounts the steps timidly.

		JANE
	Stella? Is that you?


EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is
bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she
is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the
sound of JANE's voice.

		STELLA (alarmed)
	Who - ?

		JANE (approaching closer)
	It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.

STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.
JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she
approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.

		JANE (tenderly)
	What's wrong?

		STELLA (weeping)
	He's going away. I know he is.

		JANE
	Who's going away?

STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.

		STELLA
	What am I going to tell my mother? If
	he won't marry me, what am I going to
	tell my mother?

		JANE (bewildered)
	Stella, I don't know what-

		STELLA
	Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me
	alone, you stupid thing!

STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE
stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little
frightened.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION

		O'BANION
	Let us pray.


INT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING

Most of them bow their heads.


INT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM

		O'BANION
	May the Grace of God shine upon those
	gathered here... and lift them up... and
	grant success to the endeavor to which
	they have so openheartedly declared their
	support. Amen.


INT.  THE GATHERING

They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross
themselves.


EXT.  THE PICNIC AREA

People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down.


EXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

Traveling along a country road. Headed home.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are
in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.
She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.

MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the
wagon.

NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE
she's mad at.

		NAN
	I want you two to bury the hatchet.
	You're being very silly, Jane.

		JANE (hot)
	Did you see my knees?

		MARTY
	Jane, I-

		NAN
	I think you're being mean as well as
	silly. Your brother has never had a
	scraped knee in his whole life.

Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against
her brother and the source of most of the tension in the
COSLAW family.

MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this
always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how
to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.

		JANE
	You always take his side because he's a
	cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's
	a cripple!

		MARTY
	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I
	couldn't stop him.

		JANE
	Brady's a booger and so are you!

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

		BOB (roars)
	Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of
	you out!

In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of
Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains
thundery.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

Train tracks run near the road.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY

		BOB (points)
	That's where poor old Arnie Westrum
	pitched his last drunk.

He crosses himself and they all look toward:


EXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV)


INT.  THE CAR  DAY

		BOB
	They had to pick up what was left of
	him in a peach basket.

		JANE
	Oh, Daddy! Gross!

		MARTY
	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?
	That's what Brady said.

		JANE
	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit.
	I mean it.

		NAN (no sympathy)
	You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I
	think we've all had quite enough of this
	horror-movie talk.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER  DAY

Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust.
His face is thoughtful, solemn.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls
on her unhappy face as the door is opened.

		MARTY (v-o)
	Janey?... Are you awake?

JANE says nothing.


INT.  THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY  NIGHT

He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he
was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get
a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A
box, for sure.

		MARTY
	Can I come in?


INT.  JANE

Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the
wall.


INT.  MARTY

He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night
table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over
and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can
of mixed nuts.

		JANE
	What's the money for?

		MARTY
	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

		JANE
	I don't want your money. You're a booger.

		MARTY
	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God.
	Please take the money. I want to make up.

She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite.
She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.

		JANE
	I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the
	pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.

She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She
picks it up, curious.

		MARTY
	That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it
	to me-

		JANE (scorn)
	That drunk!

		MARTY
	-but I want you to have it.

He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother
is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has
been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly
at him.

		MARTY
	Yeah, go ahead.

She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring
inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.

		JANE
	You booger!

MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.

		MARTY (grinning)
	It really is for your birthday, though -
	try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.

		JANE
	Go to hell!


INT.  MARTY, BY THE DOOR

		MARTY (smiling)
	I love you, Janey.


INT.  JANE, IN BED

She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a
response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL
evoke). She smiles at him a little.


INT.  MARTY

He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and
leaves.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON  NIGHT

We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.

SOUND: A HOWL.


EXT.  A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY

There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also
downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.

An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.

SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE

STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.


INT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU

A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her
vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the
mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.

[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the
window!]

There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the
vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty
prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture.
We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also
a large glass of water on the vanity table.

STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but
probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills,
starts to lift them to her mouth-

A HOWL outside... closer.

STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with
some water. She pauses, looking at herself.

		STELLA
	Suicides go to hell. Especially if
	they're pregnant. And I don't even care.

She takes another five pills. And another five.

SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.


EXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT

Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse,
guttural breathing.


INT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE

She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind
her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the
werewolf throws itself through.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

She sits up, startled awake.

From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A
SCREAM.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA

She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of
her nightgown.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

		MOTHER
	Oh my dear God... Stella!

She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a
confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering
glass.


INT.  STELLA'S BED, CU

One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping
through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.

Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.


EXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE

The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.

SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL.


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER

She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it
gamely along.

		MOTHER
	Stella!...Stella!

She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates
there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.

A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


INT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU

She shrieks again.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE

It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the
mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is
broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy
wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.

STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around
her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure
isn't what happened.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING

a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the
"Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The
scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can
see STELLA'S photograph.
b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see
the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a
bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER,
VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer
we'll meet later.
c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big
hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON
SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY!
d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out
and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the
parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.


EXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET

The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE.


INT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL

Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY.
And below this: JOSEPH HALLER.

		JOE HALLER (voice)
	Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER

HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks
like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy
deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly
found himself batting in the World Series.

		PETE
	What'd they say, Joe?

		HALLER
	They said they'd be here by noon.

		PETE (nervous)
	Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling
	that Smokey Bear from the Detective
	Division to fuck off, Joe.

		HALLER (morosely)
	I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a
	mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's
	go on out there.

He gets slowly up.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL  AFTERNOON

It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy
climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along
one side of the building.

SOUND: The bell rings.

A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids
spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they
are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids
book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes
and riding or just running.

Everyone has a pink report card.


EXT.  A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY
STURMFULLER

BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of
a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver
Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.
Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing
car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with
a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright
metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.
Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have
thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER
BULLET.

		BRADY
	Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and
	the Silver Bullet!

TAMMY laughs.

		BRADY
	You glad to be back in jail, Marty?

		MARTY
	Sure - I like school.

		TAMMY
	You booger.

		MARTY
	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty
	soon I'm going to start checking the
	mirror to see if I'm turning green.

		BRADY
	I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.


EXT.  THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WALNUT, A WIDER SHOT  AFTERNOON

TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his
bike.
MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He
bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by
side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY FROM THE FAR CURB, REVERSE

He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the
little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!

		MARTY
	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the
	regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.

		TAMMY
	What's that?

		MARTY
	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime
	this summer and we'd soup up the engine...
	but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and
	he's in the doghouse with my mother.

		TAMMY
	For getting a divorce?

		MARTY
	Well... it is his third.


EXT.  A STREET ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, WITH MARTY AND
TAMMY

The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has
ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road.
They look toward:


EXT.  THE RANDOLPH HOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the
stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled
with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of
state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.

We can see a large black wreath on the door.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		TAMMY
	Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was
	scared to go past her house by myself.

		MARTY (matter-of-fact)
	Yeah... it is a little scary.

		TAMMY
	I mean, I saw her. All the time.

TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.

		TAMMY
	I used to see her every day, and she never
	knew what was going to happen to her, and
	neither did I! I mean I know how stupid
	that sounds, but...

		MARTY
	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.

He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal
along to catch up.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

They stop at the end.

		TAMMY
	There's something else scary.

		MARTY
	What?

		TAMMY (points)
	That.


EXT.  OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place.
Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many
- have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle
of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a
mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She is quite deeply troubled.

		TAMMY
	I've been hearing noises in there.

		MARTY
	What kind of noises?

		TAMMY
	Rattling. Rustling.

		MARTY
	Rats...

		TAMMY
	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not
	rats and it's not kids. It's-


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT

Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic
for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of
pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap
with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of
beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold
the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching
his crotch.

		MILT
	Tammy, you get on in here and do some
	dishes!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE

Sinister...spooky.

		TAMMY (voice)
	I've got to go.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'd go out and take a look myself, but I
	think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden.
	It looks sorta greasy.

She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth.
MARTY is stunned... but happy.

		TAMMY
	You would, wouldn't you?

		MARTY (Joe Cool)
	Sure. No sweat.

		TAMMY
	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked
	since... you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises,
	tell your father. Okay?

		TAMMY
	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,
	Marty?

		MARTY (Startled)
	Jeez!


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV

There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.

		MILT (voice)
	TAMMY!

		TAMMY (calls)
	Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks
	again for coming home with me.

She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors
back onto the street and turns toward town.


EXT.  TAMMY

She brings her bike to a stop by her father.

		MILT
	'Bout time. Why you want to hang around
	that cripple?

		TAMMY
	I like him.

		MILT
	Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.
	Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance
	the fucking budget.

Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now
scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward
THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.


EXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW


			DISSOLVES TO:


EXT.  MARTY

He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some
distance away - but at least he's made it back to the
sidewalk again.

		MARTY (prayerfully)
	Come on, baby-

He looks down at:


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

Now the needle is lying all the way over on "E."


EXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON

MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug
and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the
island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS
comes over.

		VIRGIL
	Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!

		MARTY
	Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?

		VIRGIL
	Want me to check the oil?

		MARTY
	Sure!

		VIRGIL
	Wipe the windshield an check the driver's
	bullshit level?

MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the
Silver Bullet's small tank.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you
	a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a
	Rod Carew.


INT.  THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW  NIGHT

She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she
just bit into a lemon.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's
thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got
both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with
butts.

He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball
cards. Each has a pile in front of him.

MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he
looks at him.

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. I call.

He tosses in three baseball cards.

		UNCLE AL
	Wait a minute, wait a minute!

He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it
back.

		UNCLE AL
	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager!
	Stone the crows!

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

		UNCLE AL
	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.

He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.


INT.  THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE

NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She
favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at
MARTY.

		NAN
	Come on, Marty- bedtime.

She starts to wheel him away.

		MARTY
	Mom-!

		UNCLE AL
	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back
to the table.

		NAN
	Make it quick.

UNCLE AL lays down his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	Three kings.

		MARTY (delighted)
	I got a straight to the queen!

		UNCLE AL
	Bullshit luck!

		NAN (outraged)
	That's enough!

		MARTY (as his mother wheels him away)
	Aww, Mom-!


INT.  THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME

MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the
second floor. He looks dejected and glum.

SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can
make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women
like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian
household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even
bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.

A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is
no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by
arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY
hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down
the hall toward the bathroom.

Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I
mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another
is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile
of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the
table bending down to pick them up.

		NAN
	I don't want you drinking around Marty.
	That's too much. If you can't stop it,
	you better stay away.

AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this
man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal
drunkenness so we can see it.

		UNCLE AL
	I come here because Marty needs a friend.

		NAN
	Yes... you've always been that to him.
	But if you can't leave your booze in
	whatever dump you call home, you better
	just stay away.

She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after
her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering
ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire
but creating something that looks even worse. He begins
drunkenly picking up again.

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's
	house! Heeyyy!


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM

MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.

JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.

		MARTY
	Mom was really mad at him this time,
	wasn't she?

		JANE
	What do you expect, when he comes in
	smelling like a brewery and looking like
	an unmade bed?

		MARTY
	Stop it!

He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY
overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush
clatters across the tile.

		BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice)
	Hey! That you, Marty?

		JANE
	He's okay, Dad!

She looks around swiftly, then bends down.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT

One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes
are shut. He's weeping.

		JANE (low)
	Marty, are you all right?

		MARTY
	Yes. Go away.

		JANE
	Let me help you up.

		NAN (voice)
	Marty?

SOUND of her climbing the stairs.

JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then
helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink
counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please
don't tell on me," it says.

NAN comes in.

		NAN
	Jane, have you been teasing your
	brother again?

		MARTY
	She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush
	and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane
	helped pick me up.

He bats his eyes at her.

		MARTY (syrupy voice)
	Jane's wunnnderful.

JANE picks up his toothbrush.

		JANE (hands it to him)
	Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that
	shit in your head might leak down into your
	mouth and poison you.

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good
put-down.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT

We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to
pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She's deeply asleep.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door
closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from
the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer
pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer
in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.

		MILT (drunk)
	Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something-
one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and
SHATTERS.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT

He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on
the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.

		MILT (all eyes again)
	Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER

A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.


INT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM

Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks
out.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)

SOUND of another crash. Plants move.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT

He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks
inside.

		MILT
	Let's see if you want to come back and
	break my pots all to shit after I put
	some rock salt in your asses!


INT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding
the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is
really overgrown.

MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the
director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense.
I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe
even a big plump spider- will land on him.

He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.

		MILT (shouts)
	Who's there?


INT.  GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV  NIGHT

A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have
pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).


INT.  MILT  NIGHT

He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to
happen, but it keeps not happening.

Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big,
hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two
of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-
and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.

SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.

MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it
is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is
pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only
from the knees up.


INT.  TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM

She sits up in bed.

SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.

MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in
rollers, comes into Tammy's room.

		MRS. STURMFULLER
	Tammy, where's your father?

SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.


INT.  THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT

He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by
broken, splintered boards.

SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.

He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from
the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning,
splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over
it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.

A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked
all the way into the hole, board and all.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER

They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG  DAY

The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As
we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER
are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas
bags.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER

He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the
bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3  DUSK

a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home,
obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and
nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the
endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she
lurches inside and slams the door.
b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER
O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them.
c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some
plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him,
the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him
in.
d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an
automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a
pugnacious, unpleasant look.
e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber
shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to
make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I
guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE
CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's,
where he also goes in.
f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The
"Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS
SECOND VICTIM.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID  MAGIC HOUR

They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the
b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as
he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on
Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.

In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL)
WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at
the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.

Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER
ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at
the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY
McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER
LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing
a beer and listening closely to the conversation.

		ELMER (to VIRGIL)
	Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man
	up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!

		VIRGIL
	But the woman's bed was ripped right down
	the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to
	do something like that!

		PORTER
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter. (To VIRGIL) What about the
	tracks?

ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.

		VIRGIL
	That could be something to throw off the
	cops. And it ain't animals that try to
	confues the law; it's people do that.

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Law around here don't need much confusing.

PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and
ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.

		ANDY (deep disgust)
	Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if
	someone rammed it full of radium and gave
	him a Geiger counter.

		PETE SYLVESTER (comes over)
	Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd
	over getting fined two hundred bucks for
	that little fender bender out on the Ridge
	Road last year.

		ANDY
	Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to
	take care of his mouth before someone comes
	along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe
	Haller's salary to keep the people in this
	town safe, and he ain't doing it.


INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR

He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.

		BILLY (mildly)
	Last town report said you was in arrears
	your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid
	up, huh?


INT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY
	What are you, trying to be smart?

OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.

		OWEN
	You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm
	gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?

		ANDY (sulks)
	Bring me a Schlitz.


EXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK

SOUND of panting.

MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms.
His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply
behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch,
untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.

		MARTY (calls)
	Here it comes!


EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY

		BRADY
	Drop it!

As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.

		JANE
	Marty Coslaw, you get down out of
	that tree!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE

He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.

		MARTY
	Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (makes no immediate move to do so)
	Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.

		MARTY (hanging)
	Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?

		JANE
	They both are. At me, for not getting you
	sooner. I ought to let you fall.

But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He
pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.


EXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK

		MARTY (voice)
	Hey, Brady! You coming?

		BRADY (looking into the sky)
	In a while!

BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves
vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks
in Marin County might say.


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.

		JANE
	Come on, Marty.

She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and
looks at:


EXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the
bluish-purple sky.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK

The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of
LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have
appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR.
ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A
barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.

Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair
amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's
more belligerent than ever.

		ANDY (holding forth)
	This whole investigation has been as
	efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-

		PETE (bravely)
	I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If
	you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to
	shut it for you.


INT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE

It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes
in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.


INT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY (astounded)
	What did you say?


INT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER

		OWEN
	Jesus wept.

He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat.
Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically
toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries
around the bar with it.


INT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP

PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face
trembling with determination.

		PETE
	You heard what I said, motormouth.

ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a
brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table.
HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems
of his own.


INT.  HERB KINCAID

He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't
like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the
imperatives of the situation demand it right now.

		HERB (quite loudly)
	Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?


INT.  THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE

Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE
freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing
statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and
PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.


EXT.  THE TOWN COMMON, LONG

Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer
moon is rising over the horizon.

SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the
door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright
overlies each face.

NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.


INT.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL

JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry,
letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun
belt.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND

BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the
steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face
grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

		HERB
	Brady!

He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.

		HERB
	Get out of my way!

He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE
and several of the others.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND  NIGHT

		JOE HALLER (low voice)
	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
	thee. Blessed art thou among women...

He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his
side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of
his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down
two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S
smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at
nothing.

		HALLER (low)
	...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.
	Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
	us sinners now...now...

He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over
his face and starts to cry.


EXT.  THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET  NIGHT

A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a
few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID
is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.

SOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID

As HERB KINCAID approaches.

		HALLER
	Stay off the bandstand, Herb.

		HERB
	Is it my boy? Is it Brady?

		HALLER
	Don't go up-

		HERB (lunges past him)
	Brady! Brady!

Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.

		HERB
	Br-(CUTS OFF)

The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look
up.

		PETE
	Joe, is it-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh.

		PETE
	Is it the Kicaid b-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh, I said.

The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON
shoves forward.

		ANDY
	What the fuck is going on h-

SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men
flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness
on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back
further, looking more uneasy than ever.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	We'll bury his shoes.

Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury
	his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan
	cigar boxes.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV  NIGHT

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his
son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.

		HERB
	We'll bury his shoes because his feet are
	still in them and they're the only part of
	him that makes sense anymore.

HERB laughs harder.

		HERB
	It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this
	town ever saw!

HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON
BRADY'S KITE.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

SOUND: HERB SCREAMING.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In
The Sheaves."

There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but
there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG.
MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.

		JANE (v-o)
	My mother and father- my mother in
	particular- did not much care for Uncle
	Al...


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the
mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ.
BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course.
There are lots of flowers.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...but when it came to such unpleasant
	duties as taking Marty to the funeral
	of his best friend...


INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW

As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,
TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.

UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his
hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the
word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He
pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...they didn't at all mind drafting him.
	As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may
	have been able to offer him...

UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him
questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at
TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking
away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers
her the flask. Her eyes widen.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...I now believe that was best kept between
	the two of them...

After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask
and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,
who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her
mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL
smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as
if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER
looks distractedly back toward the service.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...or among the three of them.

UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. There
	will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid
	this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word
	of comfort to you, if I could.

He looks out at them.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION

They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in
understanding this awful thing.


INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN

		LOWE
	If there is any word of comfort I can give
	you, it's just this: the face of the beast
	always becomes known; the time of the beast
	always passes.

He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.

		LOWE
	If there are times when we feel alone and
	afraid, only small creatures in the dark,
	then these are the times when we must turn
	to one another for our comfort and our hope.
	To our neighbors. To our community. To our
	love for each other. I alone cannot ease
	the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can
	I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if
	I believe anything it's this: we can comfort
	each other. We can heal each other. We can
	go on together.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she
puts her head on his shoulder.


INT.  FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	The Bible tells us not to fear the terror
	that creepeth by night or that which flieth
	by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because
	there is much we don't know, and we feel
	very small. But we must not be alone. We must
	not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is
	the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to
	each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try
	to remember that the face of the beast always
	becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast
	always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.


EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY

MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins
to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would
think- and she and MARTY embrace.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU

He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY
home.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	You all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	Yeah.

		UNCLE AL
	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than
	a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You
	ever hear that one?

		MARTY
	No.

		UNCLE AL
	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They
	better get the guy.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?

		UNCLE AL
	Huh?

		MARTY
	What if it's some kind of monster?

		UNCLE AL (laughs)
	Jesus, Marty! Come off it!


EXT.  UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET

It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front,
but there are also lots of pickup trucks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?

		UNCLE AL
	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend
	they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't
	anybody ever tell you that the only monsters
	are in comic books and drive-in movies?


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  LATE AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in
	that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a
	big animal. Her father was killed that night.

UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost
believing. Then he shakes his head.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, you have to get this idea out of
	your head. Psychotics are more active
	when the moon is full, and this guy is a
	psycho. He's going to turn out to be as
	human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of
	speaking. Now let's get you inside.

He opens his door and gets out.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER

He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE AFTERNOON

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Okay, you all know what group you're in and
	what area you'll be covering, right?

		PORTER ZINNEMAN
	Damn straight!

		ELMER ZINNEMAN
	Shut up, Porter.

The men are all dressed in hunting clothes-
red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all
have guns. Among their number are a few women as well,
looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've
met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply
troubled.

ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his
vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho
football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they
really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for
the Gipper.

		ANDY
	Groups one through four are in the woods
	north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and
	six west of Carson Creek.

The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE
HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much
from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort
of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to
explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie
and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has
seriously weakened his authority.

		ANDY (continuing)
	Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.

Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and
PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up
next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.

		ANDY (continuing)
	If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight
	tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.


INT.  THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER

		PORTER (happily)
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter.


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not
	each other. So look before you-


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER

		HALLER
	I want all of you folks to go home!

A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit,
and turns to face them.

		HALLER
	I can't remember deputizing a single one
	of you!


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is
	that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one
	of you has done a damn thing about solving
	this case.

There is a mutter of agreement.


INT.  A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER

ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.
we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing
a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).

		HALLER (without much force)
	We'll catch him.

		ANDY
	You couldn't catch a cold.

HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the
crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we
see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER
speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.

		HALLER
	The law has a name for what you men are
	planning. It's private justice, and private
	justice is about a step and a half away
	from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no
	J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's
	Mills, and I want you men to go home.

They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is
getting to them.

		ANDY
	Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done
	since this thing started but hang his face out?

It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both
ANDY and themselves.

		ANDY (louder)
	He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!

		OWEN KNOPFLER
	Ah, shut up, Andy.

		ANDY
	Don't tell me to-

HERB KINCAID steps forward.

		HERB
	Yes. Correct. Shut up.

ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks
grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.

		HERB (quietly)
	I just came from my boy's funeral.

		HALLER
	Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken
	you must be...but-

		HERB (quietly)
	He was torn apart.

Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,
rapt.

		HALLER
	Yes. Yes, but-

		HERB (still quiet)
	Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.
	Constable, you don't know what those words
	mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!

HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his
face.

		HERB
	My son was torn to pieces!
		(turning back to HALLER)
	You come in here and talk to these men
	about private justice. You dare to do that.
	Constable Haller, why don't you go out to
	Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady
	and explain to him about private justice.
	Would you want to do that?

HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.

		HERB
	No. I thought not.
		(to the others)
	You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't
	ask anyone to do anything that runs counter
	to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out
	and hunt up a little private justice.

ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at
the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other
men start to follow.


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB

Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and
pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing
out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some
high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood
is up.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his
way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.
He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.

		LOWE
	Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...

		BILLY (not looking at LOWE)
	Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.

He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says
he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER
ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of
others with mounting desperation.

HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and
draws him aside.

		HALLER
	Let them go.

		LOWE
	But-

		HALLER
	This is that spirit of community you were
	talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll
	shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can
	mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit
	the Medcu van, of course.

HALLER laughs.

		LOWE
	But can't we do anything?

OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one
shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the
peacemaker bat.

		HALLER
	Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them
	get killed.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S

More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford
"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing
impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and
BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman
named MAGGIE ANDREWS.

OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.

		ANDY
	Well, it's about frigging time! They'll
	have his hide tacked to somebody's barn
	door before we get out there!

They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it
into gear and backs out onto Main Street.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE

We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of
town.


EXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE

He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in
procession, some honking their horns, others yelling
cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT


EXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT

ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a
barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged.
The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see
ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.

		ELMER
	Help me Porter, goddammit!

PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING
SOUND. ELMER screams.

		ELMER
	Don't pull me! You want to rip the right
	cheek of my ass right off?

		PORTER
	Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say
	you've been half-assed most of your-

		ELMER
	Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?

PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.


EXT.  IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS
NIGHT

O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that
priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.

SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD

		VIRGIL
	Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.

		O'BANION
	Come on. Be careful.

They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some
knee-high brush.

SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.

O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.

		VIRGIL
	Rev'runt! What is it?

		O'BANION (screaming)
	My foot! My foot!

VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.


EXT.  O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV

A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably
catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty
teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.


EXT.  O'BANION AND VIRGIL

		O'BANION (SCREAMING)
	Get it off me! Get it off me!

		VIRGIL (flustered)
	Sure...okay...

He kneels down.


EXT.  VIRGIL

He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.


EXT.  O'BANION

Relaxing.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.


EXT.  VIRGIL

Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his
hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.


EXT.  REVEREND O'BANION

He screams.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

It slides behind a cloud.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING.


EXT.  ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP

ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and
MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR.
ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.

They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES.
We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has
gone out of the evening.

They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is
filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of
it. There are woods on the far side.

		ANDY (pointing across)
	It came from over there.

		BOBBY ROBERTSON
	As far as I could tell, it could have come
	from anywhere.

		ANDY
	We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the
	bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.

		BOBBY
	I dunno-

		MAGGIE
	I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade
	in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in
	it, Bobby?

ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY
McCLAREN smile a little.

		OWEN (quietly)
	Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.

		BOBBY (stoutly)
	I ain't scared! Let's go!

		ANDY
	Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE

Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still
over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is
holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY
McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.

They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for
anything- at least, they think so.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT

They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their
way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push
toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.

SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.

They all stop, scared.

		BILLY McCLAREN
	Where's it coming from? Other side?

		BOBBY
	No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't
	trust-

		ASPINALL
	It isn't on either side.

		ANDY
	What are you-

ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.

		ASPINALL
	It's under the fog. It's right in with us.

The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:

SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.

SOUND: A SCREAM.


EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE

He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,
that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.
He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He
goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and
then it disappears.

SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.

ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a
drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE

They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in
the ranks where EDGAR was.


EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU

		BOBBY (moaning)
	I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE

The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE
LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath.


EXT.  ASPINALL, CU

		ASPINALL (low)
	I think we better start backing up, Andy.
	Real slow. Real-

The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist,
snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S
voice:

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"

SOUND: CHOMP!

ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist.
There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face
is gone.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow!"

A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP

They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one
side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.


EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV

THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like
being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.

		WEREWOLF (voice; laughing)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"


EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER

He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He
whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.

		OWEN
	Come on, then! You want to rock and roll
	with me?


EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV

For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises
out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with
gore.

		WEREWOLF
	"REEEEEL SLOW!"


EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY

		MAGGIE (shrieking)
	Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!

		ANDY (groaning with fear)
	I don't want to look at it.

He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:


EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF

The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with
the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and
slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.

		OWEN
	Come on, come on! You want to do the bop?
	I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!

The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.

Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his
hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The
peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN
shrieks.

		OWEN (voice)
	Come on, you bastard!

The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands
holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM
from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the
WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.


EXT.  THE RAVINE

THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping
down the draw.

Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a
congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the
accompaniment of a pipe organ.

		WEREWOLF (sing-songy voice)
	Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the
	sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing
	in the sheaves...

THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn
overwhelm it and we

				DISSOLVE TO:


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING

It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners
are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair
parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and
MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S
funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that
event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's
below us. The hymn ends.


INT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. They
	did ask me to say a word of comfort to you
	if I could.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID

He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.

		HERB
	There is no comfort, Father. Only private
	justice.


INT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an
actor trying to remember his lines.

		LOWE
	Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can
	give you, it's just this: the face of the
	beast always becomes known; the time-

He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.


INT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV

Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was
formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.

		LOWE
	The time... the time of the beast always
	passes. There are answers... ways... ways
	to... to cope... if we turn to each other...

		HERB (bestial voice)
	Father-

LOWE looks toward:


INT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV

He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up
and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green.
As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning
into a werewolf.

		HERB (snarling)
	It tore out his heart.

And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart
up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming
paws.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He staggers back, in terror.

		LOWE (shrieks)
	No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the
church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.

		CONGREGATION
	Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of
	kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the
	dewy eve...

We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is
happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks
up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are
split. He grins, showing big teeth.

They are all changing. Among the things we see are:

PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the
aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two
of them grapple in the aisle.

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket
covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already
the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.

TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;
the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.

At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters
of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled
hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the
organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee
Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the
tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."
It changes into the Rheingold jingle.

		CONGREGATION (snarling chorus)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


INT.  LOWE

FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.
The man is in an extremity of terror.

		REV. LOWE
	No! No! No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at
each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of
them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves-
for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the
aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously,
singing.

		CONGREGATION (snarling it out)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat...


INT.  LOWE

He looks toward:


INT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN

She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold
jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to
bubble up between the keys.

		MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL
	Won't you try, won't you buy...


INT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION

The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing
werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell.

		CONGREGATION (big finish)
	...Rheiinngold beer!

Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins.
And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them,
bites the hand's claw off.


INT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM

He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where
there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY
KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a
zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like
it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.

BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU

He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running
down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy
and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an
expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.

		LOWE (praying)
	Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please
	let it end.


EXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY

An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY
STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with
possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff
in it.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		HALLER (indifferently)
	Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.

		PETE
	Yeah... but what are they doing?

		HALLER
	Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
	cap, I deduce that they are leaving.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY

They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which
perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place
is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.


EXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK

		HALLER
	She's not the only one. Lot of people
	leaving town. And I guess if we want a
	beer, we'll have to drink it at home.

He nods toward:


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV)

A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black
wreath.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		PETE
	Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't
	never seen you like this.

		HALLER (thoughtful)
	I lost my guts.

		PETE (startled)
	Bullshit.

		HALLER
	It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him...
	and I felt it happen. It was no big deal.
	No worse than pissing down your own leg.
	You ever do that? Maybe when you were
	real scared?

PETE, distressed, does not respond.

		HALLER
	One minute I had me some guts- as much as
	the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.

PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.

		PETE
	Joe... you are going to feel better than
	this. This... this feeling of yours...
	it's gonna pass...

		JOE
	Is it?

He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign
out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while
PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.


EXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY

It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted.

THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS
FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON
EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND!

A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued
diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED.
		MARTY (voice)
	It's not fair.


INT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY

It's parked across the road from the sign.

		JANE (voice)
	Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't
	get something he wanted!

They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at
this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream
cones; they are coming home from a family outing.

		NAN COSLAW
	Stop it, Jane.

		JANE
	Well, I don't see why everybody just about
	breaks down and cries whenever he-

		BOB
	Stop it, your mother said.

They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB
pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE IN THE BACKSEAT

JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.


EXT.  ANGLE ON THE COSLAW GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the
CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.


INT.  THE GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver
Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working
through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE
AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor
and pulls it off.

		MARTY
	It isn't enough that the monster killed all
	those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's
	got them to cancel the fair.

		UNCLE AL
	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.

MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed
Shop" printed on it.

		MARTY
	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's
	all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing
	that is just a... a...

		UNCLE AL
	It's just an outward symbol of everything
	that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not
	bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in
	college. I can jive that shit all day.

		MARTY
	Well... I like it that you always know how
	to say things, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my
	ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested
	to hear that.

		MARTY
	Don't call me dear boy.

		UNCLE AL
	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.

		UNCLE AL
	Look at this.

He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated
four-barrel.

		UNCLE AL (gleeful)
	This is gonna turn your wheelchair into
	a fucking F-14, Marty-

He looks around quickly, guiltily.

		UNCLE AL
	Your mom's not around, is she?

		MARTY
	She and dad are out back lighting the
	barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's
	King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

		UNCLE AL
	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be
	Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that
	adjustable.

MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and
starts attaching bolts.

		UNCLE AL
	The guy killed your best friend, drove your
	girl out of town, and stole the second-best
	holiday in the year. Have I got it right?

		MARTY (glum)
	You got it right, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that...
	but I got something that just might cheer
	you up.

		MARTY
	What?

		UNCLE AL
	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, AT THE SIDE OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  DAY

He peeks into the backyard.


EXT.  THE BACK YARD, UNCLE AL'S POV

BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a
badminton birdie.


EXT.  THE ROAD IN FRONT OF COSLAWS', WITH MARTY

MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.

UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.

		UNCLE AL
	All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.

MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the
tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a
poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a
hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.

MARTY looks startled.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Gun it.

MARTY guns it. The engine roars.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus! Not too much!

		MARTY (awed)
	Wow.

		UNCLE AL
	You got a pilot's license, Marty?

		MARTY
	Do I need one?

		UNCLE AL
	We're gonna find out. Take it down the
	road a ways and back. Be careful.

MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but
he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving
along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the
hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying
this.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING

He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!
VRROOM!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU

A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle
engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.

SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!


EXT.  MARTY, CU

Grinning. Looking at:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV

It's about a quarter of a mile away.


EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver
Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts
back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that
of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a
motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on
his face.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG

Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke
jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the
seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's
laughing like a lunatic.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	The kid's dead meat. What have I done?
		(shouts)
	Put a rock in it, Marty!


EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET

He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing
rubber.


EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL

The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near
UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns
the engine once and then lets it idle.

		UNCLE AL
	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm
	dying. I hope you're happy, because you
	are looking at a dying man.

		MARTY
	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother
	finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have
	a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna
	Boys' Choir.

		MARTY
	I don't get you.

		UNCLE AL
	I know you don't. But I want this to be our
	secret. You get that, don't you?

		MARTY
	Sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Good.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD

The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs
on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the
f.g.

		UNCLE AL
	I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.

He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.

		NAN
	So have I, actually... I wish it could always
	be like this.

		UNCLE AL
	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure
	I stay out of trouble at least that long.

		MARTY
	Okay.

He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them
with troubled love.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Now I said I had something for you, as
	I believe you will recall.

		MARTY
	Yeah! What is it?

AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper
shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens
the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches
in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,
Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.

An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he
inventories these goodies.

		UNCLE AL
	You're gonna have the Fourth of July in
	October, Marty. Just don't blow your head
	off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't
	just the fireworks. It's because no crazy
	shithead should be able to stop the good
	guys, if you can dig that.

		MARTY (respectfully)
	I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!

		UNCLE AL
	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake-
	someone's killing people. I have to be out of
	my mind to be doing this, you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah, I know. It's great!

		UNCLE AL
	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that
	you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't
	set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?
	Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?

		MARTY
	Yeah... sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Save this one for last.

He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A
fat fuse sticks out behind the head.

		MARTY
	What is it?

		UNCLE AL
	A tracer. You'll like it.

		MARTY
	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em
	in the bushes for now.

MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a
line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets
in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out
	for the werewolves!

He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.


EXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now
the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the
downspout and begins working his way down. This should not
be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong
MARTY'S arms are.

His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he
reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple
under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the
back porch.

MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a
tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and
gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the
porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he
looks up at:


EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT

Still a light on up there.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

		MARTY (whispers)
	Shit!

Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:


EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE

MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of
exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of
silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes
and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and
starts moving again.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD

The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily
out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly
along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We
can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns
back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's
not going to be deprived of his treat.


EXT.  MARTY

He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the
starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some
more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary
choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It
cranks, but doesn't start.

MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries
again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few
times, it starts.

		MARTY (softly)
	All right!

He puts it in gear and starts off.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG

What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along
a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.

DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.


EXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT

SOUND: Fast-rushing water.

The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with
picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in
the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER
FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the
bottom.

SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.

MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He
stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of
fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time
selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole
cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a
twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top
and lights the fuse.

When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.

		MARTY (soft)
	Here's one for the good guys!


EXT.  THE TWIZZER

It flies in an arc over the drop.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT

THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of
the waterfall's catch pool.

SOUND: Growling.


EXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half
human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but
its face is in shadow.

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS

It's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back
quickly.

SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA

He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses
and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the
waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it
on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.

The fountain bursts into a shower of light.

		MARTY (delighted)
	All right!


EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

The waterfall is in the b.g.

The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It goes out.


EXT.  MARTY

He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The
Roman candle shoots into the sky.


EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE

Bursts into colored light.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the
sky.


EXT.  MARTY

He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in
the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.

		MARTY
	Is someone there?


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT

It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.


EXT.  MARTY

With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and
sets it on the ground, as before.


EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT

Claw-hands settle over the top.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die
down.


EXT.  MARTY

He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice
when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.


EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it
aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.
Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as
easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a
Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and
advances, hunched over on two legs.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (terrified)
	Who's there?


EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV

The grove is a darkened shadowland.


EXT.  MARTY

He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and
cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,
alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with
terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.


EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV

Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.


EXT.  MARTY

Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor
only cranks. Still no start.


EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET


EXT.  MARTY

He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table
where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the
matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly
drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV

We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much
closer.


EXT.  MARTY

He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same
time.
He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He
puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries
again.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS

He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.

		MARTY (voice; moaning)
	Oh, please...


EXT.  WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING


EXT.  MARTY

He is in an extremity of terror.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU

He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It
lights.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague
shadow.

(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is
not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption
that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,
toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change
at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide
coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this
point, I think we would recognize him.)


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to
the fuse. It splutters alight.


EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT

The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer
flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a
pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at
the WEREWOLF's head.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of
fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.


EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET

The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the
fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the
tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in
fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches
out of its way.


EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping
and weeping with fear.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE

It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from
its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.


EXT.  THE TRACER, CU

It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with
blood.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY

The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of
breath, still deeply frightened.


EXT.  THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF

We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles
through its fingers.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you!
	Reeeal slow!


EXT.  COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY

He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he
has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.


INT.  MARTY'S BEDROOM

His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the
windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto
his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING

SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)


INT.  THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room,
holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND
goes on.

A CLICK as the phone is picked up.

		UNCLE AL (muzzy voice)
	'Lo? Go away.

		MARTY
	It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-


INT.  UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM

Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American
Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side
of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his
skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and
heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.

		UNCLE AL
	You dreamed it, Marty.

		MARTY (voice)
	No! I went out late last night- and-

		UNCLE AL
	There are no such things as werewolves.
	Please, dear boy, have some pity.

He hangs up and falls back into bed.

		GIRL (muzzy voice)
	Whowuzzit?

		UNCLE AL
	Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.


EXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY

He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard.
JANE comes out.

		JANE
	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting
	here all morning.

		MARTY
	Where's Mom?

		JANE
	Went shopping. Why?

		MARTY
	Jane, I have to talk to you.

		JANE (mistrustfully)
	About what?

MARTY looks at her earnestly.

		MARTY
	I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't
	believe me, and if you won't help me, I...
	I...

MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying.

		JANE (concerned)
	Marty, what is it?


EXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE

JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of
beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading
MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the
Medcu unit.

		JANE (voice-over)
	He told me something that was clearly
	unbelievable... and yet, somehow I
	believed most of it. And I understood
	one thing with total clarity: Marty
	himself believed it all.

She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the
door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT

A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and
a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear
bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being
unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane?

		JANE (politely)
	I'm collecting returnable bottles and
	cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer-
	I just wondered if you had any.

Her husband comes up the hall.

		MR. THAYER
	Who is it?

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane Coslaw.


EXT.  JANE

What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.

		JANE
	Hi, Mr. Thayer.


INT.  LON THAYER, ECU

What we see mostly are his brown eyes.

		MR. THAYER
	Hello, Jane.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER

		MRS. THAYER
	Bring your cart around to the back, Jane-
	we'll look in the garage.

		JANE
	Thank you.

She starts down the steps and we


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY

Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing
her cart. Even more bottles in it now.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al
	was thirty-five that summer and I was
	fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe
	the unbelievable, although even then that
	ability is growing rusty, is preparing to
	squeal to a stop.

She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out
front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back
to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around
collar hangs informally on a bush.

		JANE (calls)
	Hi, Father Lowe!

		LOWE (without turning)
	Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!

		JANE
	I'm going to bring in a monster load
	of bottles in an hour or so!

		LOWE (still digging)
	That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.


EXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET

She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart
outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we
see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while
a few men seated at the counter listen.


INT.  JANE, ECU

Wide eyes, mostly.


INT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU

Mostly eyes.


INT.  ROBERTSON'S, FEATURING JANE

As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.


INT.  THE MEN, JANE'S POV

Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others
are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING
THEIR EYES.


EXT.  OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE

She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down
Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.

		JANE (v-o)
	Marty had seen where the tracer had
	struck home, he said, and I went out
	that day doing more than just looking
	for returnable cans and bottles- I was
	looking for a man- or woman- with only
	one eye.


INT.  THE BARBER SHOP  DAY

As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.
Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.
Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial
beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only
one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.

		BILLY
	I know what you're after, Jane, and you're
	out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in
	yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.

		JANE
	Oh... okay.

But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the
man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.


INT.  JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON

		JANE
	That you, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY FAIRTON (muffled)
	No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for
	a shave and a burger.

The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel
away from his eyes. His two eyes.

		JANE (sweetly)
	Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY
	No!

		JANE (just as sweet)
	Oh... okay.

She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she
returns to the door.

		JANE
	'Bye, Mr. McClaren.

		BILLY (amused)
	'Bye, Jane.

		ANDY (muffled)
	Jesus!

JANE goes out.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE RECTORY

She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and
goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She
leaves it there and climbs to the porch.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV

Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe-
or maybe we can't tell.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

She knocks on the screen door.

		JANE
	Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my
	bottles and cans!


INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a
raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood
smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as
you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say),
but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares-
his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.

		JANE (voice)
	Father?

		LOWE
	Take your cart around to the garage
	and unload, Jane! Then bring me your
	tally sheet!


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

		JANE
	Okay!


EXT.  JANE, A WIDER SHOT

She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around
the house.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody
chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.


EXT.  JANE, LOWE'S POV

She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage
and utility shed at the back.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the
meat again.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE SHED-GARAGE

She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE

This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and
cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which
way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload
her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.

SOUND: SQUEAKING.

JANE looks down.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV

A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked
bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.


INT.  JANE

She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,
bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an
overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING
several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then
slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.

JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.


EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY

JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-
her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She
knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It
opens.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?

No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters
the kitchen.


INT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN

She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on
the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down
here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and
into the dark hall.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...

Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.

		LOWE (voice)
	Very good, Jane!

She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:


INT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU

Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered
with a black eye-patch.

		LOWE (grins)
	Good, Jane. Very... very good.

He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it
like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black
patch, which tells her everything.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE

		LOWE (concerned)
	Jane! You're trembling!

		JANE
	I... I don't feel so well, I guess
	maybe I got too much sun.

		LOWE
	Would you like to come in the parlor and
	lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink?
	I have some soda-

		JANE
	No! (softer) That is, I have to get home
	and help my mom with lunch.

		LOWE
	I'll give you a ride!

JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.

		JANE
	No- she... she was going to meet me at the
	market. I'll be fine.


INT.  LOWE, CU

How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell
from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.

		LOWE
	Give my best to your brother, Jane.


INT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY

		JANE
	I will.

She bolts.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY

CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.

		LOWE (soft)
	Real slow.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY

His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.

		MARTY (almost moaning)
	Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?


EXT.  JANE AND MARTY

She's changed into shorts and a blouse.

		JANE
	I ran faster than I ever ran in my life-
	what do you think, dummox? By the time I
	got back here, I really thought I was
	going to faint. (Pause) What are we going
	to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody-
	grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are
	we going to do?

		MARTY (thoughtfully)
	I think I know.


INT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU

A hand- MARTY'S- comes into the frame and prints: I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.


INT.  MARTY'S ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp
focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a
moment, then begins to write again.


INT.  THE NOTEBOOK PAD, CU

He is adding: WHY DON'T YOU KILL YOURSELF?


INT.  MARTY, AT HIS DESK

He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens
a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into
it.


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET

She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox,
opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope
again.


EXT.  THE ENVELOPE, JANE'S POV

Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY
RECTORY; 149 MAIN STREET/TARKER'S MILLS, MAINE.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAILBOX

She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the
fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward
home.


INT.  THE RECTORY LIVING ROOM, WITH LESTER LOWE

He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open
envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the
lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter
hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper
in his fist.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAIN STREET MAILBOX

She drops in another letter and walks away.

		JANE (v-o)
	I mailed another letter for Marty the
	next day... a third the day after that.
	Then, on Saturday...


EXT.  THE TARKER'S MILLS COMMON, LONG

Parked at the curb is UNCLE AL'S sports car.

		JANE (v-o)
	...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.
	(Pause) His reaction was less than serene.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY, ON THE COMMON

		UNCLE AL
	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!

		JANE
	Uncle Al-

		UNCLE AL (to JANE)
	From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think
	his common sense got paralyzed along with
	his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little
	Polly Practical!

		JANE (quiet)
	You don't understand.

		UNCLE AL (wildly)
	Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that
	my niece and nephew are sending the local
	Catholic priest little love notes suggesting
	that he gargle with a broken light bulb or
	eat a rat-poison omelet!

		MARTY
	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's
	wearing an eye-patch!

		UNCLE AL
	I called Peltzer on my way over here,
	Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore
	two days ago for a bottle of otic solution.
	That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's
	got a corneal inflammation.

		MARTY
	Was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	What the hell does that matter?

		MARTY
	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because
	to get a prescription he'd have to see a
	doctor.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!

		MARTY
	Well... was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't know. But I know you didn't see
	any werewolf the other night, Marty. You
	had a dream, that's all. An extremely
	realistic nightmare brought on by what's
	been happening in this town.

		MARTY
	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in
	his shed? You know who used to have a
	baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He
	was so proud of it he used to carry it in
	the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it
	looked like the Green Giant used it for
	a toothpick!

		UNCLE AL
	You want to know what I think?

		MARTY
	No- we just got you out here so we could
	admire your pretty face.

		UNCLE AL
	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a
	hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or
	something.

		JANE (indignant)
	It was not! You want me to show you! Come
	on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!

		UNCLE AL
	No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for
	palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic
	Werewolf.

JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of
	it by now anyway.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OF ROBERTSON'S LUNCHEONETTE

The Silver Bullet stands outside. The door opens and UNCLE
AL, JANE, and MARTY come out. UNCLE AL is carrying MARTY
piggyback. MARTY has an ice cream cone. JANE is holding two.

UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY
starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone.
The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS
THEM.

		JANE
	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb,
	why hasn't he picked up the telephone and
	called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's
	sending poison-pen letters?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his
	letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept
	the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw
	Marty in his wheelchair.

		JANE
	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told
	Constable Haller that someone is sending
	him poison-pen letters?

UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:


EXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV

LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed)
	Well... he probably did. I mean, he could
	make a complaint without taking an ad out
	in the paper, couldn't he?

		MARTY
	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff
	was nonprescription. And I'll bet you
	another quarter he hasn't said anything
	to Mr. Haller.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, do you see your suspect?


EXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE

Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE
waves back.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		MARTY (grim)
	Yes, I see him.

		UNCLE AL
	Do you really think that a man who took
	a rocket in the eye three nights ago
	could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either
	be in the hospital... or dead.

		MARTY
	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot
	him when he was-

		UNCLE AL
	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.
	Jane, you don't really believe this madness,
	do you?

		JANE
	I don't know exactly what I believe. But I
	know that what I saw was a baseball bat and
	not a broomstick. I know there was something
	strange about the way the house smelled that
	day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I
	believe in Marty. I mean- there are times
	when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but
	I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to
	believe in him, too, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he
throws his hands up in disgust.

		UNCLE AL
	Kids!

He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.

She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to
catch up.


EXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY

It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In
the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back
to us in his wheelchair, watching.


EXT.  AN OLD COUPE

It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER
LOWE is behind the wheel.

SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK.


EXT.  LESTER LOWE

		LOWE (quietly)
	Little bastard.


EXT.  A FLY BALL


EXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT

The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward
town.


EXT.  MARTY

The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances
his way.

		OUTFIELDER
	You comin' down to Robertson's for a
	soda, Marty?

		MARTY
	No- I guess I'll go home.

I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression
in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.

		OUTFIELDER
	Okay- seeya!

		MARTY
	Yeah... seeya.

He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

He starts it up.


EXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV

He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the
other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the
road.


EXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV

MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer
to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL

He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.

		LOWE (whispers)
	Bastard.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's
playing center field for the Dodgers.

SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA


EXT.  MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE

MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across
the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way
by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.

LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into
the ditch.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE

		LOWE
	Oh, you bastard!

He floors the engine.


EXT.  THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS

Spinning helplessly in the dirt.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE COUPE

He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever
into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto
the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing
Silver Bullet.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY

He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks
behind.


EXT.  THE COUPE

Roars toward THE CAMERA.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.


EXT.  CHASE MONTAGE

The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple:
LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country
road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a
couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have
him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE
ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers:
ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE
JESUS!

As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is
gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he
looks down at:


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

The needle is all the way over on "E."


EXT.  MARTY

He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.


EXT.  THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET

LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves
from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for
the moment but almost overturning in the process.

They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in
fact.


EXT.  THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE

Now the needle is actually past "E."


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Come on, baby... come on...

His face registers hope as he sees:


EXT.  ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV

AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES
PROHIBITED!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going
for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's
motor COUGHS.


EXT.  THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:
BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow
makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the
Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the
mouth of the covered bridge.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a
halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND
SPLUTTERING.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL

His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become
the face of a gargoyle.


EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET

It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of
the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine
through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.
The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair
sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage
is about seventy feet.

About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last
cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along
silently, going on its dying momentum.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under
the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.


EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE

Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE
CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair
is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:


EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the
sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when
one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal
maniac close behind.


EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE

		LOWE (soft voice)
	Marty...

MARTY'S head whips around.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S
silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of
footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.


INT.  LOWE'S SHOES

Sensible black Oxfords.

		LOWE
	I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if
	you believe that or not, but it's true. I
	would never willingly hurt a child. You
	should have left me alone, Marty.

SOUND of footfalls resumes.


EXT.  MARTY

He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he
wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS

		LOWE (soft; soothing)
	I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our
	religion teaches that suicide is the
	greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.
	Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide;
	if she had done so, she would be burning in
	hell right now. By killing her I took her
	physical life but saved her life eternal.
	You see, Marty? You see how all things serve
	the will and the mind of God? You see, you
	meddling little shit!

He begins to walk forward again.


EXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV

He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not
hurrying.

		LOWE
	You're going to have a terrible accident,
	Marty. You're going to fall into the river.

SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.


EXT.  MARTY

TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER.

MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward:


EXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV

THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER
ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure
spreader which is mostly empty.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (waving madly)
	Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE

He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal
cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile.
Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?


EXT.  ELMER AND MARTY

ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it
around. MARTY looks back at:


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Empty.

SOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT.


EXT.  MARTY AND ELMER

MARTY looks back at ELMER.

		MARTY
	I ran out of gas.

		ELMER
	Spooky in there, ennit?

		MARTY (with feeling)
	It sure is!

He looks back once more toward:


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD  DAY

MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking
croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.

MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls
over.

		UNCLE AL
	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow
	without the hair and the foaming jaws.
	Also, I checked on the otic solution.
	It was counter brand. No prescription
	needed.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		UNCLE AL
	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.

		JANE (sits down)
	Did you talk to the constable?

		UNCLE AL
	After Marty called me with his latest
	Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause)
	He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged
	at all.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		JANE
	Shut up, Marty.

		UNCLE AL (reluctantly)
	There's something else.

	MARTY					JANE
What is it?					What other thing?

		UNCLE AL
	I probably shouldn't tell you- you're
	both hysterical on the subject. I'm
	starting to feel like a guy handing
	out free Arthur Murray coupons to
	victims of the dancing sickness.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-

He makes strangling gestures.

		UNCLE AL (reluctant)
	I went out to that rest area.

		MARTY (triumph)
	You found the tracer?

		UNCLE AL
	No... but I found some blood, smeared on
	a tree trunk in that grove.

		MARTY
	There! You see!

		UNCLE AL
	It could have been anything, Marty.

		MARTY
	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his
	car and trying to run me down? You don't
	think that was a dream, do you?

		UNCLE AL
	No.

UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He
looks down at:


EXT.  THE FRAME OF THE BULLET

There's a scrape and a dent where LOWE'S coupe dented it.
There is also a fleck of paint.


EXT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE, CU

		UNCLE AL
	Lowe's car-?

		JANE
	Blue. This blue.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

Three-quarters full.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE
AL'S sports car is parked out front.


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL

HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands
laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL.
There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it,
UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.

		HALLER
	That's just about the craziest damn story
	I've ever heard, Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I know. I could have edited out all of the
	completely crazy stuff, but I thought you
	deserved to hear it with the bark on.

		HALLER
	I appreciate that. Now, the next question:
	Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?

		UNCLE AL
	Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should
	be checked out.

HALLER rises.

		HALLER
	That can be arranged.

They shake hands.


EXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT

A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the
side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he
does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over
his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's
shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember
them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the
picture. He goes up the walk.

HALLER rings the doorbell.

No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one
comes. He leans down and looks through a side window.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV

No one there.


EXT.  HALLER

He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and
then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and
looks in.


EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV

LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans.


INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER

He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down.
In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda
cans.

HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He
lights it and looks at:


INT.  THE COUPE, CU

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in
the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come
into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE
CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY
has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does
LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.


INT.  HALLER

His eyes widen.

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about
nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum
scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and
werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In
one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.

HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA
CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and
falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy,
but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and
again and again.


EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE
DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.
The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.

		MARTY
	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and
	guess what? No one sees him again!

		UNCLE AL
	And what do you suggest I do about it,
	dear boy?

MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it
to UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	I want you to turn this into a silver
	bullet.

		UNCLE AL
	You're not going to let it go, are you?

		MARTY
	I saw what I saw.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

		JANE (quietly)
	In the made-up stories, the guy who's the
	werewolf only changes when the moon is full.
	But maybe he's really that way almost all
	the time, only as the moon gets fuller...

		MARTY (finishes)
	...the guy gets wolfier.

		JANE (hands AL her crucifix)
	Here. Take mine, too.

		MARTY
	Jane... you don't have to do that.

		JANE
	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I
	don't, booger-brains.

		MARTY
	Will you marry me, Jane?

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy
	Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?

		JANE
	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

		MARTY
	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or
	exactly what it is- but people still
	believe in it.

		UNCLE AL
	The kid is eleven years old and already
	he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

		MARTY
	I think he's going to come for me. Not
	just because I know who he is, but
	because I hurt him. Only I don't think
	he'll try again as Lowe.

		UNCLE AL
	Dear boy, you have gone right out of
	your mind.

		MARTY
	Will you do it?

UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the
wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short
lane and into a gravel pit.

THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can
see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's
bloody and chewed.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY

The wagon pulls in.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Please, Uncle Al.

		JANE
	Will you?

The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from
the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the
medal and looks at it.

		UNCLE AL
	All right. I give up. Yes.

  MARTY							JANE
All right! Thanks!				Thank you, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	If either of you ever tells anyone I even
	bought a piece of this story, werewolves
	will be the least of your problems.


EXT./INT.  SILVER BULLET MONTAGE

a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a
	gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an
	old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard
	of weapons.

b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All
Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,
using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale
is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	God knows what sort of story my uncle
	told him, but I think that for men who
	have been married as often as Uncle Al,
	invention on short notice becomes
	something of a specialty.

c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
	silver content of my crucifix and Marty's
	medallion...

d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S
melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...melted them down...

e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...and molded them into a silver bullet.


INT.  MAC'S GUN SHOP, WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL  DAY

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He
puts it down on the glass counter top.

		MAC
	Here it is.


INT.  THE BOX, CU

MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on
dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a
pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet
optically- not much, just a little- to make it look
absolutely magical. Almost holy.


INT.  MAC AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to
the light.

		MAC
	Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think.
	It's got a low-grain load so it won't
	tumble. Should be pretty accurate.

		UNCLE AL
	It's just a gag, that's all. What would
	you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?

		MAC (joking)
	How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy
	Halloween, Al.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm summer air.

		JANE (voice-over)
	By the time Marty's silver bullet was done,
	it was Halloween... and the full moon had
	come around again. Earlier that afternoon,
	my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer
	for over seven years, finally finished the job.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved
jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door.
UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon
is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway;
MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.

NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has
obviously been crying.

		NAN
	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton
	in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral
	parlor. It's Stickney and-

		UNCLE AL
	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!

The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.

		NAN
	And don't open the door for any trick or
	treaters even if they come!

		UNCLE AL
	We won't!

The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out
again.

		NAN
	You kids go to bed on time! You've got
	school tomorrow!

		UNCLE AL
	If you keep doing that, you're going to
	bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama-
	tell her I'll see her Thursday.

		NAN
	I will- be good, kids.

  MARTY							JANE
'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!				We will! 'Bye!

The station wagon accelerates away.

		UNCLE AL
	Can I tell you kids something?

		JANE
	Sure, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	When me and sissy were kids, we were
	just like you two.

		MARTY
	Yeah? Really?

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still
	are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

He ushers them inside and closes the door.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN

		BOB
	I can't believe that you'd agree to leave
	the kids with him. A year ago I would have
	laughed at the idea. You used to almost
	breathe fire when Al came in the house.

		NAN
	He's changed. Just this summer. Or
	something's changed him. Marty, maybe.
	And the drinking- I think it's almost
	stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful.
	And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure
	of it.

		BOB
	I know they'll be safe with him... but will
	he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?

		NAN (firmly)
	If I told him to, he will.


INT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

It reads 1:00.

SOUND: The National Anthem.


INT.  THE TV, CU

The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card.

		ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	This concludes WDML's broadcast day.

The TV goes to snow.


INT.  JANE ON THE COUCH

She's mostly asleep in one corner.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's also dozing.


INT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV

He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans
in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is
smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his
lap.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE

The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side
yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of
the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom).


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-
it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this,
its one eye flaring.

DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to
his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.

MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its
jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS
GROW LOUDER.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY

UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette
out of his lap and puts it out.

		JANE (sleepy)
	You'll burn yourself up sometime doing
	that, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

		MARTY
	But Uncle Al! You said-

		UNCLE AL
	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten
	past one. He's not coming.

		JANE
	The moon's not down yet...

		UNCLE AL
	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this
	stupid gun in my lap because I promised,
	but you two are going to bed. Go on,
	now, scoot.

JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.

		MARTY
	What if I say no?

		UNCLE AL
	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.
	(more kindly) Go on, now.

MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs,
where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the
living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and
stops.

		MARTY
	If that'd gone off, it would have been the
	end of our silver bullet.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down
and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five
chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet
into his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.

Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its
green eye flaring.


INT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is
looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.

		JANE (shrieking)
	It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!
	IT'S THE WEREWOLF!

She's pointing at the window.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL
has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the
silver bullet loosely held in the other.

Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to
the kids.

		UNCLE AL (sharply)
	You see it, Marty!


INT.  MARTY

		MARTY (shakes his head)
	I was looking at you...


INT.  UNCLE AL

His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare
is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're
just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is
actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!

		UNCLE AL
	A very familiar feeling is beginning to
	creep over me.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

JANE is crying.

		MARTY
	What's that, Uncle Al?


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	I feel like a horse's ass.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

		JANE (weeping)
	I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!

MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a
comforting arm around her shoulder.

		JANE
	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!

		MARTY
	Jane-


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids go to bed? My head's
	starting to ache.


EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, ECU

We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close
around a thick wire.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	Reeeal slow...

It yanks.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

The lights go out.

JANE SHRIEKS.

		MARTY
	It's here! It's outside!


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Jane, it's just a power fai-

He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall-
not just the window it was looking through before but the
whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way
through, roaring.

UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire-
but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are
empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF
smashes him aside.


INT.  UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE

He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver
bullet another.


INT.  THE GUN

It spins into a living-room corner.


INT.  THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION

We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes
down, hits the floor, and rolls.


INT.  THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION

In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling
toward it.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE

		MARTY
	Get the gun!

He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into
the hall.


INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION

The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In
the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.

He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.

His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in
the heating vent.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his
shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the
pistol.

The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through
the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and
hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward
her.


INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Comes toward her.


INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER

She makes as if to run one way.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is
toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.


INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU

A bloodstained hand grabs a poker.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE

As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and
strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.

UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.

It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it
aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that
now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.


INT.  JANE

She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward
the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Its head whips around.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille
off. One arm is down inside.

		MARTY (scream)
	Janey! The gun! THE GUN!


INT.  JANE

She tosses it awkwardly.


INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION

It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,
awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

		WEREWOLF (snarls)
	Maa-aaa-rty...

It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing
things out of its way.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the
heating duct again...


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping
fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an
inch out of reach.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF (foaming)
	Maaa-aaa-rty...


INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR

		JANE (sobbing)
	Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!

She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back
into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this
is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't
have to pay for.

		WEREWOLF
	Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-


INT.  MARTY, CU

He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the
approaching WEREWOLF.


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet
blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the
cylinder closed.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!


INT.  MARTY

He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a
click. An expression of dismay on his face.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Kill you...


INT.  MARTY

He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.
He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The
Bullet hits the wall.


INT.  MARTY

Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a
third time. Click!

The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.


INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!

It bends down, reaching.


INT.  MARTY, ECU

Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls
the trigger again.


INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE

The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He
flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and
crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits
there, roaring... and then it begins to change.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE

She lies there, sobbing.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	You okay, Janey?


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps
JANE up.

		JANE
	I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU

Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;
it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.

It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.


INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR

		MARTY (calls)
	I'm all right. He's dead.


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in
the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying
on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...
and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at
her.

She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really
dead. I think. Until the sequel.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY

UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing
again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and
draws her down beside himself and MARTY.

		UNCLE AL (to MARTY)
	There. I told you there weren't any such
	things as werewolves.

They smile at each other with love.

		JANE (nervous)
	Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or
	whatever it is?

		UNCLE AL
	If it isn't now, it will be after I pound
	one of your mother's silver candlesticks
	through its heart.

		JANE (grimaces)
	Oh Uncle Al, no!

		UNCLE AL (grim)
	Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I
	believe it all the way.

He gets up and leaves.

		JANE
	Are you all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

		JANE
	You're a real booger, you know it?

		MARTY (smiles)
	I love you, Jane.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG  NIGHT

Quiet. Sleeping.

		JANE (voice-over)
	It wasn't always easy for me to answer
	that... but I could answer it that night,
	and I find I can say it now that the
	terrible events of that fall have receded
	to memories which seem little more than
	dreams in my mind.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (hugging him)
	I love you, Marty.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG

		JANE (voice-over; no more than a whisper)
	I love you, Marty... good night.

THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.

					FADE OUT.


  VAN HELSING

      by

Stephen Sommers
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
LIGHTNING FLASHES across the OLD UNIVERSAL LOGO. And then a
FLAMING TORCH BURNS IT AWAY and we find ourselves in the
middle of an angry mob of torch-wielding PEASANTS. Crashing
through a dark forest. Heading for a huge CASTLE. A BOLT OF
LIGHTNING STRIKES conductors above the skylight on top of the
castle. - This entire opening sequence is in BLACK & WHITE.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
A PAIR OF STRANGE EYES suddenly comes alive, peering out
through slits in stained bandages.
A MAN spins around into a CLOSE-UP, his elegant face is
covered in soot, sweat, and taut lines of exhaustion. But his
eyes sparkle with an incredible intelligence, bordering on
madness. This is DOCTOR VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN. He yells one of
the most famous phrases in film history:
                    VICTOR
          He's alive .... He's alive!! ...
          HE'S ALIIIIVE!!!
Behind him, lying in a form-fitted iron pod, is a huge man,
face covered in bandages. A loud CRASH spins Victor around,
he runs to a window and looks out. Over his shoulder we see
the mob charge the front gate with a tree trunk-CRASH! Wood
SPLINTERS. But the gate holds. Victor starts to panic, he
spins around and comes face-to-face with a DARK FIGURE.
                      DRACULA (DARK FIGURE)
          Success!!
Victor SCREAMS in fright, then catches himself
                    VICTOR
          Oh ... Count ... it's just you.
The Dark Figure steps forward into the flickering electrical
light-show. Tall, dark, and incredibly handsome, he reeks of
evil. This is COUNT VLADISLAUS DRACULA.
                    DRACULA
          I was beginning to lose faith,
          Victor.
He looks our at the screaming mob.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          A pity your moment of triumph is
          being spoiled over a little thing
          like grave robbery.
                                                         2.



EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT
A creepy guy in a TOP HAT and undertaker's suit YELLS OUT:
                    TOP HAT
          You know what he's doing in there!
          To the bodies of your loved ones!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Victor is clearly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
                    VICTOR
          I must ... I must escape this
          place.
Victor dashes across his laboratory; the Industrial Age at
its grotesque beginnings. Weird iron generators and enormous
copper dynamos line the walls. Huge gears GRIND. Massive fan
belts WHIRL. Electricity ARCS everywhere. Dracula is now high
up in the rafters, as if magically transported.
                    DRACULA
          Where are you going to run, Victor?
SPARKS rain down as Victor throws open a traveling chest and
wildly begins packing. Dracula is suddenly on the complete
opposite side of the room, pacing the mantelpiece.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Your peculiar experiments have made
          you ... unwelcome, in most of the
          civilized world.
Victor looks up at Dracula, momentarily confused by Dracula's
impossible moves.
                    VICTOR
          I'll take him away, far away, where
          no one will ever find him.
He starts packing again, bur Dracula is suddenly right next
to him. He steps on the lid of the trunk and slams it shut.
                    DRACULA
          No, Victor, the time has come for
          me to take command of him.
                    VICTOR
          What are you saying?
                                                        3.


                    DRACULA
          Why do you think I brought you
          here? Gave you this castle?
          Equipped your lab?
                    VICTOR
          You said you believed in my work.
                    DRACULA
          And I do. But now that it is, as
          you yourself said, "a triumph of
          science over god," it must now
          serve my purpose.
                    VICTOR
          What purpose?

EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT
WHAM! goes the tree trunk. Splinters FLY. The gate starts to
give. The Crowd CHEERS. Thunder ROARS.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Victor's eyes slowly widen in horror, he starts to back away.
                    VICTOR
          Good lord ... I would kill myself
          before helping in such a task.
                    DRACULA
          Feel free. I don't actually need
          you anymore, Victor. I just need
          him ... he is the key.
Dracula moves in for the kill. Victor backs away towards the
roaring fireplace, eyes narrowing in defiance.
                    VICTOR
          Before I would allow him to be used
          for such evil, I would destroy him.
                    DRACULA
          I cannot allow that to happen. My
          brides would be very put out.
                    VICTOR
          IGOR! ... Help me!
A despicable little hunchback with horrible buck teeth and an
evil eye stares down from the rafters. This is IGOR.
                                                        4.


                    IGOR
          You have been so kind to me.
          Doctor, so caring and thoughtful
              (gestures out to the mob)
          But if they catch me, they'll hang
          me again.
Igor reveals his horribly disfigured broken neck. Victor
quickly reaches the mantel and grabs a sabre crossed over the
Frankenstein family coat-of-arms.
                       VICTOR
          Stay back!
                    DRACULA
          You can't kill me, Victor ...
Dracula impales himself on Victor's sabre and keeps walking,
impaling himself all the way up to the hilt, bringing the two
men eye-to-eye. Victor is beyond shocked. Dracula smiles.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          ... I'm already dead.

EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT
CRASH! goes the front gate. EXPLODING into splinters.
Peasants and torches pour through. LIGHTNING FLASHES.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Dracula's canines glide out into razor sharp fangs, all the
blood drains from his face, his hair turns pure white. Victor
SCREAMS. The Count bites down into his neck.
Up in the rafters, Igor scurries off through a door, slamming
it behind him as Victor's SHADOW is murdered above it.
Dracula drops Victor's limp body to the floor. And that's
when a horrific ANGUISHED BELLOW suddenly fills the room.
                       FRANKENSTEIN
          NOOO!
Dracula spins around, dropping Victor to the floor. A dynamo
hits Dracula full on. He and the dynamo are flung into the
fireplace, scattering flaming logs and embers.
A bandaged APPARITION scoops Victor into its arms.
                                                           5.



EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT
Igor scurries our a small door outside the castle wall and
closes it behind him, then he looks up over the wall to the
peasants storming the upper ramparts. He cackles in glee. The
door behind him suddenly bursts open. The Apparition races
out, carrying Victor in its arms. It blows past Igor and
heads off across the moors, heading for an old WINDMILL up on
a bluff. Igor is shocked and panicked, he quickly looks up at
the peasants and points to the Apparition.
                    IGOR
          FRANKENSTEIN! He's created a
          monster!!
Igor fearfully scurries off into the shadows.

EXT. RAMPART - NIGHT
Up on the ramparts, Top Hat points down SCREAMS:
                    TOP HAT
          LOOK! It's headed for the windmill!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
From inside the fireplace, the Count flings the massive
dynamo across the laboratory. It hits a generator that blasts
into a flume of sparks and fire. The Count charges out of the
fireplace, his face is a burned mess, but it quickly and
completely heals.

EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
The mob charges across the moors, chasing the Apparition
towards the windmill.

INT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
The mob charges the windmill. The creature slams the door
shut on them, then dashes across the room, which is an old
Absinthe Still. He rampages up a rickety wooden staircase.

EXT. TOP OF WINDMILL - NIGHT
At the top of the windmill, the creature rages through a
splintering door and looks down at the crazed mob below. We
finally get our first good look at FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER:
bolts, scars, stitches, and the back of his head is made of
glass, a small electrical storm is going off inside it. But
the look in his eyes surprises us, he is terrified, this
tremendous beast of a man is actually fearful.
                                                        6.


                       FRANKENSTEIN
          Why? ...

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Dracula's SHADOW rises up the laboratory walls and TRANSFORMS
into something huge, with wings.

EXT. TOP OF WINDMILL - NIGHT
Frankenstein groans in fear as a thick unbroken band of
FLICKERING TORCHES encircles the windmill. The SCREAMING
peasants throw their torches. A noose of FLAME leaps up the
walls. The Monster ROARS. Then looks off at the castle. Off
in the distance, the castle's glass skylight bursts as a
WINGED SHADOW explodes up out of it. High up in the dark,
thunder-racked sky, THREE MORE liquid-like SHADOWS come
flying through the roiling purple clouds to join it.
                    PEASANTS
          Vampires! Run for your lives!
The huge crowd flees in horror across the moors. The FLAMES
have surged up the windmill and now surround Frankenstein's
Monster. He looks down at Victor and hugs him tightly to his
chest.
                       FRANKENSTEIN
          Father ...
Then with tears on his cheeks, he lifts a fist towards the
oncoming shadows above and lets our an anguished BELLOW.
And that's when the entire windmill IMPLODES. Taking the
Monster and his creator down with it. The timber and the
gears and the fans and all the ironwork plummet downward. A
huge ball of FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS flies everywhere.
Huge billowing WINGS suddenly fly right over CAMERA,
practically WIPING FRAME. They immediately become a CAPE,
which wraps around Dracula as he hits the ground running.
And then three billowing WHITE WINGS fly over CAMERA, and
they wrap around three exorically gorgeous young women.
Dracula's BRIDES: ALEERA, VERONA, and MARISHKA.
Dracula staggers to a stop and stares in desperation at the
flaming wreckage. His Brides are distraught beyond words:
they burst into tears, wailing with inhuman shrieks.
                                                           7.


WE PUSH IN on the FLAMING windmill, belching its last sparks,
then slowly DISSOLVE TO its charred remains.
                                    SUPER: ONE YEAR LATER

EXT. WINDMILL - DAY
The BLACK & WHITE ends, the FILM SATURATES, becoming a deep
blue, and then a huge, powerful BLUR rips past the ruins. The
sound it makes is incredibly deep, feral, and frightening.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - GLOOMY DAY
Looking down through MASSIVE TREES onto a small clearing. A
handsome young MAN is tied to a post, hands above his head.
PRINCE VELKAN tenses at the sound of the approaching beast.
And then all goes quiet. Bushes rustle. Velkan's eyes look
left. A tree creaks. Velkan looks right. A branch sways.
Velkan waits for the inevitable. And then, 30 feet up a tree,
a massive WEREWOLF creeps out, clinging horizontally to the
bark. Ten feet tall. Fangs. Claws. The works. It hunches,
about to lunge. Velkan tenses.
                    VELKAN
          Come on. Dracula unleashed you for
          a reason.
The Werewolf leaps. Velkan's hands rip loose of his bindings.
He vaults himself up onto the top of the post just as the
Werewolf slams into it, just missing him. The Werewolf clings
to the post and looks up as Velkan leaps up and grabs a vine
hanging above the post.
BEHIND SOME BUSHES: Several MEN pull a lever.
The vine jerks Velkan up off the pole, heading for safety,
but then he comes to an abrupt stop. The look in his eyes
tells us this isn't part of the plan.
Behind the bushes the men are struggling with the lever.
                    VILLAGER
          It's stuck! It's stuck!
A gorgeous young woman spins around and draws her sword: she
wears the sexy silk dress of a gypsy Princess, this is ANNA
VALERIOUS. One of the men grabs her.
                    MAN
          No! Anna! It will kill you!
                                                           8.


                    ANNA
              (ripping free of his grip)
          That's my brother out there!
Out in the clearing, the Werewolf snarls up at Velkan and
starts to hunch, about to lunge up at him. Anna charges out
of the bushes. The Werewolf sees her. So does Velkan.
                      VELKAN
          Anna! No!
Anna raises her sword and keeps on charging. The Werewolf
snarls viciously and jumps off the pole, it immediately falls
through a camouflaged mesh covering the ground.
Behind the bushes a man swings an ax and chops the ropes
attached to the lever.
Out in the clearing, a huge iron CAGE rips up out of the
ground around the pole. Anna does a back-flip off the cage as
it's pulled up into the air.
Up on the vine, Velkan draws his silver revolver. The roof of
the cage springs shut, trapping the Werewolf inside. Velkan
aims down at the Werewolf, but the cage slams into him on
it's way up into the trees. His revolver goes flying. Velkan
and the cage are rocketed straight up into the huge trees.

EXT. FOREST - TREETOPS - DAY
Way up in the trees, the cage slams to a stop. Velkan leaps
off and lands on a branch. The cage starts crashing back and
forth, the Werewolf trying to rip its way out. Ropes snap.
                    VELKAN
          My gun! Find my gun!

EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - DAY
Down in the clearing, Anna desperately looks around, several
men begin firing rifles up into the trees, Anna shoves one of
them out of her way.
                    ANNA
          No! Find Velkan's gun! It has to be
          the silver bullets!

EXT. FOREST - TREETOPS - DAY
Another rope snaps. The cage swings widly, now hanging by a
single rope.
                                                          9.



EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - DAY
Anna spots Velkan's silver revolver on the far side of the
clearing. She runs for it. The cage suddenly SLAMS DOWN right
in front of her, cutting her off from the gun. The Werewolf
bursts out of the smashed cage. Anna turns and runs like
hell. The Werewolf spots her and gives chase.
Anna races through the foliage. The Werewolf's POV getting
closer and closer. Anna runs out of the forest and almost
goes over a cliff. She stops herself just short, it's a half
mile to the bottom, she spins around and starts to run back
into the foliage, then freezes as she sees trees and bushes
thrown into the air, the Werewolf getting closer and closer.
The Werewolf leaps out of the bushes, straight at Anna. Anna
is suddenly shoved out of the way by Velkan. He fires his
gun. The Werewolf HOWLS in pain, but manages to chomp into
Velkan's shoulder and tackle him OFF THE SCREEN.
Anna slams to the ground, then spins around, Velkan and the
Werewolf are gone. Only the revolver remains, still smoking.
Anna leaps up and looks over the edge of the misty cliff.
Velkan is nowhere in sight. Anna is devastated.
                       ANNA
          Velkan ...
And then she hears something and spins around. It's the
Werewolf, lying in the bushes. Anna grabs the gun, levels it,
cocks it, and moves in for the kill. And that's when the
Werewolf TRANSFORMS, turning into a dying OLD MAN.
                       OLD MAN
          Thank you.
Anna stares down at him, horrified. The Old Man smiles.
                    OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          I die free from Dracula's awful
          grip.
And then with the last of his energy he grabs Anna's ankle.
                    OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          But now you must stop him! ... He
          has a terrible secret ... He has
          ... he has ... !
                                                       10.


The Old Man dies. Anna stares down at him, then looks off
over the precipice. WE PUSH IN on her tear-streaked face as
she shuts her eyes. Then PULL BACK as another FACE DISSOLVES
UP over hers. It's a "WANTED POSTER." Wanted for murder in
many countries is a MASKED MAN wearing a cloak, a cape, and a
black, wide-brimmed hat. His name is VAN HELSING. A HAND rips
the poster off the SCREEN and we suddenly find ourselves in:

PARIS, FRANCE - RAINY NIGHT
The hand belongs to a masked man in a cloak, a cape, and a
black, wide-brimmed hat. In the background is the Eiffel
Tower, half built. It's quiet. Too quiet. And then we hear a
blood curdling SCREAM. Van Helsing's eyes don't even flinch,
he calmly crumples the poster, chucks it, and moves off down
the foggy cobblestone lane, his cape flowing behind him.

EXT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT
WE PAN DOWN from NOTRE DAME to a WOMAN'S DEAD BODY lying on
the cobblestones in a puddle of blood, eyes wide open,
looking terrified. Van Helsing steps up and gives the body
the once over, studying the spoor. He picks up a smoldering
cigar stub next to the body, dripping with saliva, then he
freezes, eyes suddenly on the alert, he spins around and we
RACK FOCUS to the top of Notre Dame.
Way up on the North Tower, a huge, shadowy FIGURE clambers up
the sheer wall and vanishes over an upper railing.

INT. NOTRE DAME BELFRY - NIGHT
Van Helsing silently steps up into the belfry, which is dark
and dusty and covered in religious relics. Very Gothic.
Moonlight slices through the attic windows as Van Helsing
glides past the massive church bell, then he freezes, every
hair and muscle on his body suddenly tense. A long BEAT.
And then a gigantic malformed MAN DROPS DOWN three feet in
front of him, hanging upside-down from the rafters. He SNARLS
viciously. This is MISTER HYDE. Van Helsing gingerly takes
one step back, then pulls down his mask, revealing his
handsome face for the first time.
                     VAN HELSING
          Evening.
Hyde's fleshy jowls spew phlegm as he speaks, a burning cigar
clamped between his rotten teeth.
                    MISTER HYDE
          You're a big one. You'll be hard to
          digest.
                                                         11.


                    VAN HELSING
          I'd hate to be such a nuisance.
Hyde flips around and lands on his gnarled feet. Van Helsing
sizes him up, all nine feet of him.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          I missed you in London.
                    MISTER HYDE
          No you didn't.
Hyde lifts up his huge arm to show three cauterized BULLET
HOLES blown clear through his biceps.
                    MISTER HYDE (CONT'D)
          You got me good.
Hyde starts to circle. Van Helsing does likewise.
                    VAN HELSING
          Doctor Jekyll, you are wanted by
          the Knights of the Holy Order-
                    MISTER HYDE
          It's Mister Hyde now.
                    VAN HELSING
          -for the murder of twelve men, six
          women-
                    MISTER HYDE
          -Four children, three goats and a
          rather nasty massacre of poultry.
          So you're the great Van Helsing.
He blows a huge smoke ring at Van Helsing. Van Helsing
ignores it.
                    VAN HELSING
          And you are a deranged psychopath.
Hyde takes the red-hot cigar out of his mouth and crushes the
glowing his palm.
                    MISTER HYDE
          We all have our little problems.
Van Helsing's whole mind and body to gear up.
                    VAN HELSING
          My superiors would like for me to
          take you alive, so that they may
          extricate your better half.
                                                       12.


                    MISTER HYDE
          They would, would they?
                    VAN HELSING
          Personally, I'd rather just kill
          you and call it a day.
Mister Hyde laughs. Van Helsing doesn’t.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Let's make it your decision, shall
          we?
Hyde suddenly LASHES OUT with one of his huge hands, catches
Van Helsing across the face, slams him back into a wall. Van
Helsing calmly wipes the blood off his mouth.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Good, we're in agreement then.
In a lightning quick move, Van Helsing draws his revolvers
and FIRES. Like all of Van Helsing's weapons, they are highly
stylized, yet ruthlessly functional. The sound is thunderous.
As the smoke clears, Hyde is nowhere to be seen. Van Helsing
holsters his guns and moves forward. Mister Hyde suddenly
charges out of the darkness. Van Helsing instantly comes up
with circular BLADES in each hand. He spins around and cuts
Hyde across the ribs as he passes. Hyde howls in pain and,
unable to stop his own momentum, crashes straight into the
huge church BELL, which GONGS loudly. Hyde grabs his ears.

                    MISTER HYDE
          The bell! THE BELL!!

Van Helsing moves in for the kill. His fingers start pumping
the spring-loaded blades, which begin to rotate, faster and
faster until they're a menacing blur of razor sharp steel.

Hyde grabs the huge bell, rips it off its moorings and slams
it down over Van Helsing, trapping him inside. Hyde chuckles.
And then he hears the blades buzzing away inside. Hyde looks
concerned, grabs the bell, and lifts it up. Van Helsing is
gone, and there's a big hole carved out of the wooden floor.

Hyde scowls, then hears the blades buzzing again. He looks
around. Van Helsing is nowhere in sight, then he looks up.
Van Helsing is crouched up inside the bell above Hyde's head.
He swings a blade. Mister Hyde's left arm drops to the floor.
Cut clean off. The bell crashes to the floor. Van Helsing
rolls free. He and Hyde stare at the severed arm, flapping
away on the floor.
                                                       13.



                    VAN HELSING
          I'll bet that's upsetting.

The huge arm TRANSFORMS into the arm of a spindly old man.
Mister Hyde angrily lunges forward, grabs Van Helsing, and
throws him clear up through the top of the tower.

EXT. NORTH TOWER - NIGHT

Van Helsing explodes up through a wooden trap door and
crashes down hard to the deck. He tries to get up, but he's
nearly unconscious. Hyde leaps up beside him, picks him up by
the back of his collar and carries him across the tower.

                    MISTER HYDE
          I think you'll find the view over
          here rather spectacular.

At the edge of the tower, Hyde lifts Van Helsing up face-to-
face.

                    MISTER HYDE (CONT'D)
          Been a pleasure knowing you.
Mister Hyde throws Van Helsing off the top of Notre Dame.
OKAY, EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION:

As Van Helsing plummets towards the cobblestones far below he
desperately whips out a grappling hook gun, aims, and fires
it upwards. The bolt shoots out, tether trailing behind it.
It blows right through Hyde's belly and shoots out of his
back.

TIGHT on the bolt as it slows in mid-air, tether slackening,
and then the serrated grappling HOOKS snap out, the tether
goes taut, and the whole thing is jerked back out of FRAME.

The grappling hooks slam into Mister Hyde's back. The tether
goes taut. Van Helsing snaps to a stop at the end of the
tether, two feet short of splattering into the cobblestones.
Hyde is jerked forward, but catches himself on the ledge. Van
Helsing gets to his feet, grabs the tether and yanks it. Hyde
is jerked over the edge, but a single toe stops him from
falling, his lone arm flails, and then with all his might he
throws himself backwards. READ FASTER:

Van Helsing is jerked up off the ground. Hyde stumbles back
and falls off the tear of the tower, he drops down and
crashes through the roof of the church. Van Helsing rockets
up the side of Notre Dame, heading for the top of the tower.
                                                         14.



INT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT

Mister Hyde swings down across the great church and right
into the Rose window.

EXT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT

The massive window at the front and center of Notre Dame
explodes as Mister Hyde crashes through it. Van Helsing lands
on his feet at the top of the tower and looks down.

WE FOLLOW Mister Hyde down as he TRANSFORMS into a meek OLD
MAN, who has one deeply disturbing moment to consider his
predicament. And then he hits the pavement.

Up on the tower, Van Helsing looks genuinely remorseful, his
body slumps in sadness, he makes the sign-of-the cross.

                    VAN HELSING
          God rest your soul. ...

EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT

Gendarmes, priests, and local denizens race up to the dead
body from every direction. Then they all look up to the top
of the North Tower, and are instantly terrified, several of
them run away in fear.

                    PEOPLE
          Van Helsing! ... It's Van
          Helsing!...

Silhouetted against the moon is our hero. The SERGEANT of the
gendarm raises an angry fist.

                    SERGEANT (O.S.)
          Van Helsing you MURDERERRRR ...

SMASH CUT TO ROME - DAWN

The clock behind St. Peter's Basilica chimes as Van Helsing
trots his black stallion across the enormous Piazza San
Pierro, lined with Bernini's magnificent colonnades.
                                      SUPER: VATICAN CITY

INT. ST. PETERS - DAWN

Gregorian CHANTING can be heard as Van Helsing strides
through the greatest church in all Christendom.
                                                       15.



INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY

Inside an ornate confessional, Van Helsing drops to one knee.

                    VAN HELSING
          Bless me, Father, for I have
          sinned.

Knowing what's coming, Van Helsing grits his teeth. A tiny
partition door slams open. Through the wooden mesh we see
CARDINAL JINETTE, a tough old bird with piercing eyes.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          You shattered the Rose window!

                    VAN HELSING
          Not to split hairs, sir, but it was
          Mister Hyde who did the shattering.

                    THIRTEEN
          Thirteenth-century. Over six
          hundred years old! I wish you a
          week in hell for that!

                    VAN HELSING
          It would be a nice reprieve.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          Don't get me wrong, your results
          are unquestionable, but your
          methods draw far too much
          attention. "Wanted posters"? We are
          not pleased.

                    VAN HELSING
          You think I like being the most
          wanted man in Europe? Why don't you
          and the Order do something about
          it?

The Cardinal leans in and lowers his voice conspiratorially.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          You know why, because "we" do not
          exist.
                    VAN HELSING
          Then neither do I.

Van Helsing gets up to go. The Cardinal pulls a lever. Bolts
on Van Helsing's door lock shut. The Cardinal leans in, all
fire and brimstone.
                                                       16.



                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          When we found you crawling up the
          steps of this church, half dead, it
          was clear to all of us that you had
          been sent to do God's work.

                    VAN HELSING
          Why can't he do it himself?

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          Don't blaspheme! You already lost
          your memory as a penance for past
          sins.

The Cardinal pulls another lever, a series of gears slides
the back wall open, revealing a secret hidden staircase.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          If you wish to recover it, I
          suggest you continue to heed the
          call.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

The Cardinal and Van Helsing enter an enormous underground
ARMORY, bustling with action, lots of steam and fire.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          Governments and empires come and
          go, but we have kept mankind safe
          since time immemorial.

Beneath the giant blast furnaces we see JEWISH RABBIS working
the billows, HINDU PRIESTS stoking the fires, and MUSLIM
CLERICS hammering red hot scimitars on anvils.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          We are the last defense against
          evil. An evil that the rest of
          Mankind has no idea even exists.

Van Helsing's eyes fill with torment, reliving past moments:

                     VAN HELSING
          To you, these monsters are evil
          beings to be vanquished, but I'm
          the one left standing there when
          they die and become the men they
          once were.
                                                       17.



                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          For you, my good son, this is all
          a test of faith. That is why you
          have no idea who you are or where
          you came from.

Van Helsing gives him a look. The Cardinal smiles knowingly.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          Say you met God, and he set you on
          a task, you would have no fear
          because you would know that God was
          with you, but if your memory of
          meeting God were lost, then every
          day would be a test of faith.

Van Helsing sighs heavily, we see the weariness in his eyes,
the weight of his calling pressing down upon him. The
Cardinal snaps his fingers and the LIGHT DIMS. A Rabbi turns
on a SLIDE PROJECTOR and starts clicking slides, showing the
way from Rome to Eastern Europe.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          We need you to go to the east, to
          the far side of Romania, an
          accursed land, terrorized by all
          sorts of nightmarish creatures.

A slide of a handsome GOTHIC PRINCE comes up.
                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          Lorded over by a certain Count
          Dracula.

Van Helsing's interest is immediately piqued.
                     VAN HELSING
          Dracula.

Then a slide comes up showing a painting of an old fifteenth-
century NOBLEMAN, his suit of armor covered in holy crosses,
his name emblazoned on silver below it: VALERIOUS THE ELDER.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          Four hundred and fifty years ago a
          Transylvanian knight named
          Valerious the Elder promised God
          that his family would never rest,
          nor enter heaven, until they
          vanquished Dracula from their land.
          They have not succeeded, and they
          are running out of family.
                                                       18.



Several grainy black-and-white slides of a FAMILY come up. A
burly old KING and young Prince Velkan.

                     CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          Boris Valerio us, King of the
          Gypsies, he went missing almost one
          year ago. His son Velkan died just
          last week.
                    VAN HELSING
          And the girl?

Van Helsing gestures to Anna, riding her horse.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          Princess Anna, the last of the
          Valerio us. If she is killed, nine
          generations of her family will
          never enter the gates of St. Peter.

The room FLOODS WITH LIGHT. The Cardinal faces Van Helsing.

                     CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          For more than four centuries this
          family has held down our left
          flank. They gave their lives, we
          cannot let them slip into
          purgatory.

                    VAN HELSING
          So you're sending me into hell.
                    CARDINAL JINETTE
          In a manner.

An old Muslim Cleric steps up and hands something to the
Cardinal. The Cardinal holds it up for Van Helsing. It's a
TORN PIECE OF PAINTED CLOTH encased in a strip of glass.
                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          The old knight left this here four
          hundred years ago. We don't know
          its purpose, but he would not have
          left it lightly.

Van Helsing stares at it. Painted on the cloth is PART OF A
LATIN INSCRIPTION.
                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          In Latin inscription translates as:
          "In the name of God, open this
          door."
                                                       19.



And then a look of confusion washes over Van Helsing's face.
In the corner of the cloth is an INSIGNIA in the shape of a
DRAGON. Van Helsing holds his hand up next to the insignia.
On Van Helsing's hand is a RING with the exact same DRAGON
INSIGNIA. The Cardinal sets his hand on Van Helsing's arm,
fatherly.

                    CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
          I think that in Transylvania, you
          may find the answer you seek. . . .

On Van Helsing's look WE CUT TO:

INT. ARMORY - DAY

Van Helsing strides through a huge blast of steam. An
extremely earnest little Friar scurries up, this is CARL.

                    CARL
          There you are. Did you bring him
          back? Or did you kill him?

Van Helsing doesn't even slow down. Carl shakes his head.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          You killed him, didn't you? That's
          why they get so annoyed. When they
          ask you to bring someone back, they
          don't mean as a corpse.

Van Helsing scowls under his breath. Carl smiles.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Ah! Right. You're in a mood. Well,
          come on, I've got a few things that
          will put the bit back in your
          mouth.

Van Helsing is suddenly attracted to some swords coming out
of a flaming forge. Carl grabs him and pulls him away.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Any idiot can make a sword.

A huge, beefy, Buddhist Monk covered in sweat steps out from
behind the forge, staring daggers at Carl.
                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Sorry, father!

Carl grabs some items off a shelf and stuffs them into Van
Helsing's arms:
                                                          20.



                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Rings of garlic, holy water, a
          wooden stake, a silver crucifix ...

Van Helsing watches some Spanish priests fire a Gatling gun.

                    VAN HELSING
          Why can't I use one of those?

Carl looks at Van Helsing like he's talking to a child.

                    CARL
          You've never gone after vampires
          before have you?

                    VAN HELSING
          Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
          they're all the same, best when
          cooked well.

                    CARL
          They are not all the same. A
          vampire is nothing like a warlock.
          My granny could kill a warlock.

                    VAN HELSING
          Carl, you've never even been out of
          the abbey, how do you know about
          vampires?

                    CARL
          That's why they make books.

He gestures to a collection of manuscripts by Socrates,
Copernicus, Da Vinci, and Galileo, then steps up to a glass
OVEN where sticks of dynamite are dripping sweat into vials.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Here's something new. Glycerine 48.

Carl sticks his pinky into a vial and then flicks a drop of
the dynamite sweat against a wall, the drop bursts into a
large ball of flame. Several of the startled clergy YELL OUT:
                    SEVERAL PRIESTS
          Knock it off, Carl!

                    CARL
          Sorry! Sorry!
              (aside to Van Helsing)
          The air around here is thick with
          envy.
                                                       21.



Carl grabs a strange-looking CROSSBOW :and hands it to Van
Helsing, it's covered in little iron pumps and copper tubes.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          This is my latest invention.
                    VAN HELSING
          Now this I like.

                    CARL
          Gas propelled, capable of
          catapulting bolts in rapid
          succession at tremendous velocity.
          Just pull the trigger and hold on.
              (he adjusts the sight)
          I've heard the stories coming out
          of Transylvania, trust me, you'll
          need this. A work of certifiable
          genius.

                    VAN HELSING
          If you don't say so yourself.

Carl doesn't get sarcasm.

                    CARL
          I did say so myself.
              (earnest, not bragging)
          I am a veritable cornucopia of
          talent.

Van Helsing picks up a very odd-looking CONTRAPTION.

                    VAN HELSING
          Did you invent this?

                    CARL
          I've been working on that for
          twelve years. It's compressed magma
          from Mount Vesuvius with pure
          alkaline from the Gobi Desert. It's
          one of a kind.
                    VAN HELSING
          What's it for?

                    CARL
          I have no idea, but I'm sure it
          will come in handy.

Carl scurries on as Van Helsing follows.
                                                       22.



                    VAN HELSING
          Twelve years and you don't know
          what it does?

                    CARL
          I didn't say that. I said I don't
          know what it's for. What it does is
          create a light equal to the
          intensity of the sun.
                    VAN HELSING
          And this will come in handy how?

Carl hefts two huge duffle bags filled with weaponry into Van
Helsing's arms.

                    CARL
          I don't know. You could blind your
          enemies. Charbroil a herd of
          charging wildebeest. Use your
          imagination.

                    VAN HELSING
          No, Carl, I'm going to use yours,
          that's why you're coming with me.

                    CARL
          The hell be damned if I am.

                    VAN HELSING
              (points an accusing
               finger)
          You cursed. Not very well, but
          you're a monk, you're not supposed
          to curse at all.

                    CARL
          Actually, I'm still just a friar, I
          can curse all I want ... damn it.

                    VAN HELSING
          The Cardinal has ordered you to
          keep me alive ...

He shoves the huge duffle bags into Carl's arms.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          ... for as long as possible.

Van Helsing turns and heads off through the flaming forges.
Carl, carrying the huge duffle bags, staggers off after him.
                                                       23.



                    CARL
          But I'm not a field man!

A blast of STEAM fills FRAME, and then the CAMERA is suddenly
flying through CLOUDS ....

EXT. TRANSYLVANIA - GLOOMY DAY

The CAMERA rips out of the clouds and dives down between two
craggy mountain peaks, revealing the strange village of
VASERIA nestled in the heart of a creepy valley. The CAMERA
whips down into the village and crests the rooftops, as it
lands next to a chimney, three WHITE WINGS drop down around
it and TRANSFORM into familiar gowns. The CAMERA holds on the
village square below, bustling with activity. Aleera trembles
with anticipation.

                    ALEERA
              (Romanian - subtitled)
          I am very, very excited about this.

Marishka pours.
                    MARISHKA
              (Romanian - subtitled)
          Why can't we just let the Werewolf
          kill her?

Verona gives her a condescending look.

                    VERONA
          Never trust a man to do a woman's
          job.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY
Wearing hoods, heads down, Van Helsing and Carl move through
the vicious-looking crowd. Carl whispering to Van Helsing.

                    CARL
          ... so you can remember everything
          about your life from the last seven
          years, but nothing before that?
                    VAN HELSING
          Not now, Carl.

Van Helsing's keen eyes are busy casing the locals.

                    CARL
          There must be something?
                                                          24.


                    VAN HELSING
              (dead serious)
          I remember fighting the Romans at
          Masada.

                    CARL
          That was in 73 A.D.?
                       VAN HELSING
          You asked.

Carl suddenly notices what Van Helsing has already taken in,
the villagers have been sneaking suspicious glances at them.

                    CARL
          What are we doing here? Why is it
          so important to kill this Dracula
          anyway?

                    VAN HELSING
          Because he's the son of the devil.

                    CARL
          I mean besides that.

                    VAN HELSING
          Because if we kill him, anything
          bitten by him or created by him
          will also die.

                    CARL
          I mean besides that.

Van Helsing gives him a look. Top Hat steps up to them.

                    TOP HAT
          Welcome to Transylvania.

All the villagers suddenly have knives, machetes, and
pitchforks in their hands, and they're all staring at Van
Helsing and Carl. Carl nervously whispers to Van Helsing.

                    CARL
          Is it always like this?
                    VAN HELSING
          Pretty much.

A pair of RIDING BOOTS step up onto the well in front of
them. It's Anna, she gestures to the two men.

                    ANNA
          You! Let me see your faces.
                                                          25.



Under the hat, we see Van Helsing's eyes taking her in.
                    VAN HELSING
          Why?

                    ANNA
          Because we don't trust strangers.

                    VAN HELSING
          I don't trust anyone.

Top Hat pulls out a measuring tape and starts measuring Carl.

                    TOP HAT
          Strangers never last long here.

                     ANNA
          Gentlemen, you will now be
          disarmed..

Several village men move forward. Van Helsing glares at them.
                    VAN HELSING
          You can try.

The men stop in their tracks, their resolve ~ wavering in his
glare.

                    ANNA
          You refuse to obey our laws?

                    VAN HELSING
          The laws of men mean little to me.
                     ANNA
          Fine.
              (she looks out at the
                crowd)
          Kill them.

All the villagers raise their weapons and start to close in.

                    VAN HELSING
          I'm here to help you.

                    ANNA
          I don't need any help.
                    VAN HELSING
          Really?
                                                       26.



Van Helsing whips the crossbow out from behind his back, the
bow snaps out aimed right at Anna. Anna reacts and ducks,
REVEALING the three brides flying in formation right behind
her, coming right at her.

The brides are now HUGE, WHITE VICIOUS BATS FROM HELL, we
know it's the brides because their faces are very distinct
within the composition of the creatures.

Van Helsing fires. Three bolts. The brides split up as the
bolts whiz past, just missing them. The white spectres swoop
up over the rooftops and around the Byzantine church spire.
                    VILLAGERS
          Nosferatu!!

All hell breaks loose. The bats rocket around the square,
ripping doors and shutters off their hinges, blowing tables
and chairs end-over-end, throwing people ass-over-teacups.
                    ANNA
          Everybody inside!

Van Helsing keeps firing, trying to get a bead on them.
Aleera swoops down, heading for Anna. Anna sees her coming
and leaps off the well, right onto Van Helsing, they crash to
the ground. Van Helsing looks at Anna sprawled across him.

                    VAN HELSING
          Normally, I don't like women who
          throw themselves at me ....

Anna is suddenly ripped up off of him by Marishka. Van
Helsing bounds up onto the well, leaps out and grabs Anna.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Thought you said you didn't need
          any help.

The two of them drop free and hit the ground. Anna lands on
Van Helsing, her thighs straddling his face. He grabs her and
rolls her to the ground.
                       VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Stay here.

She grabs him and rolls him to the ground.

                    ANNA
          You stay here. They're trying to
          kill me.
                                                       27.



Anna instantly leaps up and runs. Van Helsing gets up to go
after her, then spots his crossbow through the trampling
crowd. Verona and Marishka fly up over the rooftops.

                    VERONA
          Marishka, my dear, please kill the
          stranger.
                     MARISHKA
          Love to.

Van Helsing grabs his crossbow and spins around to see Aleera
and Verona flying through the chaos, tossing peasants out of
their way, chasing Anna. Van Helsing dashes across the
square, he fires again, sending Aleera scattering.
                    VAN HELSING
          Carl! I'm out!

Carl races forward, pulls out a clip and throws it to Van
Helsing. Van Helsing catches it just as Marishka swoops in on
him. Van Helsing dives to the ground in the nick of time.
Marishka’s clawed feet end up grabbing a cow, she lifts it
into the air and pitches it through a second-story balcony.

Van Helsing leaps up, slams the clip home and spins to see
Anna racing across the far side of the square, Verona still
on her tail. Van Helsing shoulders the crossbow and fires,
multiple bolts, rapid fire, tremendous velocity. Dozens of
arrows rip into the storefronts all around Verona and Anna.
Anna leaps over some crates as Verona swoops over her, just
missing her. Verona grabs a running man and lifts him up into
the air. The man screams in horror. Verona just smiles.

                    VERONA
          Be happy in the knowledge that your
          blood shall keep me beautiful.

Verona bites into his neck. Top Hat cackles at this from
behind a rack of coffins. Anna leaps up from behind the
crates, dozens of arrows are imbedded everywhere. Anna gives
Van Helsing an angry look.

                    ANNA
          Who are you trying to kill?!

The whole square suddenly goes dead quiet. The brides are
nowhere in sight. All the villagers are hunkered down,
looking around. Van Helsing gives Anna a questioning look.
She nods upwards.
                     ANNA (CONT'D)
          The sun.
                                                       28.



Van Helsing sees a sliver of SUN shining through the clouds.
Then he hears a loud SPLASH. He and Anna turn and look at the
well. They move in on it, weapons drawn. They peer into the
well. Above them, the clouds cover the sun. Carl reacts.

                    CARL
          Van Helsing!

Too late. Aleera rockets up out of the well. Van Helsing is
blown back as Aleera grabs Anna and flies up into the air.
Van Helsing leaps up and aims, but he can't get a clear shot.

Anna’s boots skim the rooftops. She reaches down with her
free hand, withdraws a SWITCHBLADE from an ankle strap,
flicks it open and slashes Aleera’s ankle. Aleera SHRIEKS
with a mouth filled with fangs, then throws Anna into the
air. Verona swoops in and grabs her. The blade goes flying.

Van Helsing tracks the huge bat with his crossbow, then fires
a single shot. The lone arrow impales Verona’s foot, she
SHRIEKS in pain and rage. Anna drops free, falls onto a
rooftop and tumbles down. She manages to grab a gutter forty
feet up and dangle precariously. She leaps off the roof,
flips through the air, lands upside down on the side of a
tree, then jumps the rest of the way to the ground and runs
like hell. And that's when Carl sees something.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Van Helsing! Two o'clock!

Van Helsing pivots in time to see Marishka coming right at
him. He fires. A half dozen bolts peg into Marishka. She
spirals wildly across the square and crashes straight through
the side of a building.

INT. VILLAGE HOME - DAY

Anna sprints into a house, slams the door shut, bolts it
tight and turns to go. Aleera's face is right in front of
her, dangling upside down from a ceiling beam, she licks her
bleeding ankle and smiles coquettishly.

                    ALEERA
          Do you know how long I have wanted
          to kill you?

Anna is clearly afraid, but trying to hide it as she slowly
backs away.

                    ANNA
          Aleera, did I do something to you
          in a past life?
                                                       29.



Aleera flips off the beam and lands between Anna and the
door. Anna backs away into the living room as Aleera closes
in for the kill.

                    ALEERA
          Don't play coy with me, Princess,
          you're just like all the other
          pretty little ancestors in your
          family. Saying you want to destroy
          my master, but I know what lurks in
          your lusting heart.

                    ANNA
          I hope you have a heart, Aleera,
          because someday I'm going to drive
          a stake through it.

Aleera throws a casual UPPERCUT, launching Anna like a rag-
doll through a closed window.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Anna crashes through the shattering window, lands catlike on
the ground, and launches herself down an adjacent alley.

EXT. SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing and Carl creep towards the building that Marishka
crashed though. From inside they can hear sobbing.

                    MARISHKA (O.S.)
          My face, look what you've done to
          my face ...

Van Helsing slowly moves towards the building, crossbow
shouldered. The front door suddenly blows open. Marishka
blasts out and BACKHANDS Van Helsing fifty feet through the
air. His crossbow goes flying.

Marishka wings around the square, arrows imbedded in her
chest and face. Carl dives out of her way as she rips the
arrows our, one by one, then lands on a balcony and
TRANSFORMS back into a beautiful girl. Van Helsing rolls over
in time to see Marishka's wounds COMPLETELY HEAL. Carl leaps
up.

                    CARL
          This should do the trick!

Van Helsing looks at him. Carl throws a familiar steel and
glass bottle.
                                                       30.


                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Holy water!

The bottle flips through the air, Verona suddenly swoops in
and snatches it. She throws it into the well and looks at
Marishka.
                    VERONA
          Finish him.

Then she flies off. Marishka looks at Van Helsing and smiles.
                    MARISHKA
          Too bad. So sad.

Van Helsing looks over at THE CHURCH. WE CRASH ZOOM across
the square to a TIGHT SHOT of a basin of Holy Water. Then WE
WHIP PAN onto Marishka, she looks from the Holy Water to Van
Helsing. His eyes. Her eyes. Both of them are gearing up.

INT. PUB - DAY

Anna careens into a pub and skids to a stop. Aleera is
casually sipping a glass of very red wine. A man lies dead
across the bar next to her. Anna spins around, but Verona is
now right behind her.

                    VERONA
          Hello, Anna, my dear.

She starts to move in for the kill. Anna stumbles back into a
wall, cornered.

                    ANNA
          You won't have me, Verona.

Verona just smiles pleasantly and licks her lips.

                    VERONA
          The last of the Valerious.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing looks at his crossbow, half way between him and
Marishka. Marishka leaps up onto the balcony railing, her
arms out, ready to take flight, daring him to make the first
move. Van Helsing goes for it. Racing for the crossbow.
Marishka leaps out and TRANSFORMS into a huge bat. Van
Helsing dives and rolls as Marishka swoops over him. Van
Helsing leaps up with his crossbow.
                                                       31.



EXT. PUB DAY

Verona opens her mouth, her canines distend into horrible
fangs. Anna throws a punch. Verona grabs her hand, lightning
quick, and forces Anna to her knees. Aleera steps up.

                    ALEERA
          I want first bite.

Verona nods her consent. Aleera bends down for the kill.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing runs like hell for the church. Marishka plunges
down into the square, laughing wildly. Van Helsing makes it
to the basin and slams the tips of his arrows into the water.
Marishka rockets right at his back, claws and fangs extended.
Van Helsing spins and FIRES. Bolts from the crossbow strafe
into the rocketing bat, only this time Marishka SHRIEKS
horribly, accompanied by the sound of sizzling flesh. She
spirals up and SLAMS into the middle of the church spire.

INT. PUB - DAY

Verona and Aleera both SCREAM. Anna is blown across the pub
by a shock wave of wind as the brides become bats.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing pivots as the two spectres crash up through a
rooftop and fly into the air, he aims to fire, but they
quickly fly off, WAILING insanely. Van Helsing steps back
from the church and looks up.

The dying bat is pinned to the spire by the arrows in it's
chest. The crowd goes quiet, staring up as the hellish thing
slowly TRANSFORMS back into a gorgeous young girl. Marishka
glares down at Van Helsing and hisses, then DECAYS into
molten rot, shrieking all the way.

Carl looks over and notices the cow, standing on the second
floor balcony, looking confused.

As the villagers crawl out from under all the wreckage, some
of them start pointing accusing fingers at Van Helsing

                    VILLAGERS
          He killed a bride. He killed
          Marishka! He killed a vampire!

Now Carl is confused.
                                                        32.



                    CARL
          Isn't that a good thing?

Top Hat steps up with an amused smile.

                    TOP HAT
          The vampires only kill what they
          need to survive, one or two people
          a month. Now they will kill for
          revenge.

The angry villagers move in with their pitchforks and
machetes. Carl looks back at Van Helsing.

                    CARL
          Are you always this popular?
                    VAN HELSING
          Pretty much.

Top Hat smiles politely and tips his hat at Van Helsing.

                    TOP HAT
          And what name, my good sir, do I
          put on your gravestone?

And that's when Anna steps up.

                    ANNA
          His name is Van Helsing.

A MURMUR washes over the Transylvanian crowd, but unlike with
the French, it is in admiration, not fear.

                    VILLAGERS
          Van Helsing... It's Van Helsing...

Anna gives Van Helsing a nod.

                    ANNA
          Your reputation precedes you.

Van Helsing gives her a hard look back.

                    VAN HELSING
          Next time, stay close, you're no
          good to me dead.

Anna is momentarily ruffled by this, then she laughs.
                                                       33.



                    ANNA
          Well, I'll say this for you, you've
          got courage.
              (she turns to the crowd)
          He's the first one to kill a
          vampire in over a hundred years!

She gives the handsome rogue an appraising look.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          I'd say that's earned him a drink.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA TOWER - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a DRAGON INSIGNIA, like the one on Van Helsing's
ring. Carved into an open COFFIN covered in snow and ice. The
snow and ice suddenly melt into STEAM as Dracula rises up out
of it.
                    DRACULA
          MARISHKAAA-!!

We are deep in the bowels of a thirteenth-century fortress.
It's like nothing we've ever seen before. Everything is
covered in a thick permafrost. Great icicles hang down from
the ceiling. Icy stalagmites rise up from the floor.

With weird, feral movements, Dracula jerks himself out of his
coffin and walks up an enormous pillar. As he passes ancient
candelabras, the candles mysteriously ignite.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          If it's not the Christians, it's
          the Moors! Why can't they just
          leave us alone. We never kill more
          than our fill. And less than our
          share. Can they say the same?

Dracula walks UPSIDE DOWN across the forty-foot-high ceiling.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Did I not say how important it was
          to finish with these Valerious.

He comes face-to-face with Verona and Aleera, hanging from a
beam by their feet, cradled in each others arms, sobbing.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Now that we are so very close to
          fulfilling our dream?
                                                       34.



The brides wail in anguish, Dracula's demeanor changes on a
dime, from anger to sympathy.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          There, there, my lovelies. Do not
          worry, I shall find another bride.

The brides are appalled.

                    ALEERA
          Do we mean so little to you!?

                    VERONA
          Have you no heart!

                    DRACULA
          No! I have no heart. I feel no
          love. Nor fear, nor joy, nor
          sorrow. I am hollow! Soulless! At
          war with the world and every living
          soul in it! ... But soon ... very
          soon, the final battle will begin.

His demeanor changes on a dime again, he smiles curiously.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          I must find out who our new visitor
          is.

Dracula jumps the forty feet to the ground with ease. The
huge SHADOW of a Werewolf prowls across the wall behind him,
a chain around its neck. Dracula smiles at it.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          We'll have to make a special
          aperitif out of him. We are much
          too close to success to be
          interrupted now.

Both brides immediately panic and leap off their perch, drop
the forty feet and land next to Dracula.

                     ALEERA
          No, my lord! Please! Say you won't
          try again!

                    VERONA
          My heart could not bear the sorrow
          if we fail again.
                       DRACULA
          SILENCE-!!
                                                       35.



The brides cower in fear. Dracula is immediately horrified,
as if he hurt a little child, he envelops them in his cape.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          No, no, no. Do not fear me, you
          must not fear me, everyone else
          fears me.

The brides calm down and begin to purr in his grasp.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          But we must try ... we have no
          choice but to try .... For our own
          survival.

Dracula inhales, smelling his brides, but his reverie is
broken by the roar of the Werewolf. Behind them, the
werewolf's shadow is being poked by a long stick held by a
HUNCHBACK'S SHADOW; the poking is accompanied by the sound of
electric shocks.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Igor!

The creepy hunchback himself scurries up, slipping across the
ice, carrying a ten-foot-long electric cattle prod.

                    IGOR
          Yes, Master!

                    DRACULA
          Why do you torment that thing so?

                    IGOR
          It's what I do.

                    DRACULA
          Remember Igor, "Do unto others."

                    IGOR
          Yes, Master, before they do unto
          me.
                    DRACULA
          Now go.

Dracula looks up into the rafters.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          All of you!
                                                       36.



A large gang of vile little DWERGI are perched along the
beams. German Gothic trolls, short and squat, with weird
masks and goggles that completely hide their faces.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          To Castle Frankenstein!

INT. VALERIOUS MANOR ARMORY - NIGHT

A huge door is thrown open, revealing the Valerious ARMORY.
Four centuries' worth of nasty weaponry in cases and racks.
Anna charges in, a woman on a mission.

                    ANNA
          So how did you get here?

                    CARL
          We came across the Sea.

                    ANNA
          Really? The sea? The Adriatic Sea?

Van Helsing is all business.

                    VAN HELSING
          Where do I find Dracula?

                    ANNA
          He used to live in this very house,
          four centuries ago, no one knows
          where he lives now.

She gestures to a huge oil PAINTING covering an entire wall,
a rich and fantastical MAP OF TRANSYLVANIA.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          My father would stare at that for
          hours looking for Dracula's lair.

Anna grabs a sword, an iron mace, and some throwing stars.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          So that's why you've come?
                    VAN HELSING
          I can help you.

                    ANNA
          No one can help me.
                       VAN HELSING
          I can try.
                                                          37.



                    ANNA
          You can die trying. All of my
          family has. I can handle this
          myself.
                    VAN HELSING
              (wry sarcasm)
          So I noticed.

Anna spins on him, angry.

                    ANNA
          The vampires attacked in daylight,
          they never do that. I was
          unprepared. It won't happen again.

                    VAN HELSING
          Why did they attack in daylight?

                    ANNA
          Clearly they wanted to catch me off
          guard. They seem almost desperate
          to finish off my family.

                    VAN HELSING
          Why is that? Why now?

                    ANNA
          You ask a lot of questions.

                    VAN HELSING
          Usually I ask only two, what are we
          dealing with, and how do I kill it?

Anna straps on a metal chest plate and spiked gauntlets.

                    ANNA
          My father spent most of his life
          looking for answers, year after
          year,
              (gestures out the window)
          tearing apart that tower, combing
          through the family archives.

On that, Van Helsing looks at Carl, admiring the weaponry.

                    VAN HELSING
          The tower. Start there.
                    CARL
          Right.

Van Helsing keeps staring at Carl. Carl looks confused.
                                                       38.


                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Now?

Van Helsing doesn't even bother to respond. Carl quickly
heads out.
                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Right. The tower. Now.

Anna grabs a scabbard, straps it on and heads for the swords.
Van Helsing blocks her path.

                    VAN HELSING
          The only way to save your family is
          to stay alive until Dracula is
          killed.

                    ANNA
          And who will kill him if not me?
          Who will show courage, if not me?

                    VAN HELSING
          If you go out there alone, you'll
          be outmanned and out-positioned.
              (gestures out a dark
               window)
          And you can't see in the dark.

Anna laughs this off and moves forward. Van Helsing closes
the gap between them, inches from her eyes.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          In the morning, we'll hunt him
          together.

Anna stares up into his dark eyes.

                    ANNA
          Some say you're a murderer, Mister
          Van Helsing, others say you're a
          holy man, which is it?

                    VAN HELSING
          A bit of both, I think.

A slight smile creases Anna's beautiful face.

                     ANNA
          I promised you a drink. The bar is
          down the hall, help yourself. As
          for me ...
              (her eyes go dark)
          I'm going.
                                                         39.



Anna grabs a sword and slams it into her scabbard. Van
Helsing watches her.

                      VAN HELSING
            I'm sorry you have to carry this
            burden.

                      ANNA
            On the contrary, I would wish for
            it no other way.

And she means it. She grabs a vicious-looking helmet, black-
on-black with sharp metal flanges. Van Helsing stares at her
respect for her growing.
                      VAN HELSING
            And I'm sorry about your father and
            brother.

                      ANNA
            I will see them again.

She turns to Van Helsing, her convictions rock solid.

                      ANNA (CONT'D)
            We Transylvanians always look on
            the brighter side of death.
                      VAN HELSING
            There's a brighter side of death?

                      ANNA
            Yes, it's just harder to see.

She slams   her helmet on and starts to charge out. Van Helsing
grabs her   arm, spins her around and blows a blue powder into
her face.   Anna falls back into a wall, out cold. Van Helsing
grabs her   in his arms before she falls to the floor.
                      VAN HELSING
            I'm sorry about that too.

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - RAINY NIGHT

Manor Valerious spikes up into the dark sky, where menacing
clouds roil across a FULL MOON. The MUSIC tells us we're
building to something very scary.
                                                       40.



INT. ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna is waking up on her bed, her clothes are on, but her
armor and weapons have been removed. She suddenly sits up and
CURSES in ROMANIAN, then leaps out of bed.

                    ANNA
          Oh my god that hurts ...
              (then she gets angry)
          That son-of-a-bitch.

She leaps out of bed and storms for the door.

EXT. GRAND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Except for the RAIN splattering against the windows and the
ominous music, it's quiet, very quiet, as Anna storms down
the hall. Suddenly, something CREAKS. Anna freezes. The sound
came from behind a door. Anna opens it and enters.

INT. VALERIOUS ARMORY - NIGHT

Anna steps into the armory and angrily looks into the dark.

                    ANNA
          Van Helsing!?

Another CREAK. Coming from somewhere in the cases. Anna is
suddenly on the alert, her eyes scan the gloom. She grabs a
lantern out of a sconce and moves into the racks. Another
CREAK. Anna stops and cocks the lantern back, whoever it is,
she's going to let them have it. Then she moves on, and then
slowly peaks around a corner. It's just an open window, the
wind and rain forcing the shutter to creak against the wall.
Anna breathes a sigh of relief. Steps over and closes the
window, the FULL MOON glows outside. And then she sees WET
PAW PRINTS on the floor, her breath hitches. Her eyes follow
the paw prints, which vanish out in the middle of the floor.

HIGH ANGLE POV: A single eerie musical note signals the
presence of something evil, looking down on Anna. Anna
instantly knows she's in trouble, starts backing away,
breathing harder, she grabs a spiked mace. The POV slowly
glides across the ceiling, following her.

Anna feels the presence, but she doesn't know where it's
coming from, she spins around. Nothing's there. She moves on,
quicker now, weaving through the cases of weaponry. Then she
hears a LOW GROWL and freezes, trapped in the middle of the
armory, she cocks her arm back. A long terrifying beat.
                                                       41.



And then a single drop of rain drops down onto her cheek.

Anna looks straight up. It's a Werewolf Fangs. Claws. Fur.
Dripping wet. Dangling from a beam above her, staring down.
It ROARS. Anna runs like hell, past a window. WE HOLD on the
window to see dark clouds completely cover the full moon.

Anna rounds a corner and slams into someone. She screams and
starts to swing the mace. VELKAN grabs her arm. Anna is
shocked.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          Velkan! Oh my God! You're alive!

                    VELKAN
          Quiet, Anna, I only have a moment.

                    ANNA
          But Velkan, there's a Werewolf]

                    VELKAN
          Never mind that! Listen to me! I
          know Dracula's secret! He has
          mumblich nowger lochen ...

Velkan has lost control of his mouth. And that's when Anna
notices that his clothes are torn to shreds. Anna recoils.
Velkan's body starts to spasm and jerk, he lurches STRAIGHT
UP THE WALL. He desperately forces his head to turn and look
out a window.

The roiling clouds suddenly clear and reveal the full moon.
                       VELKAN (CONT’D)
          Anna! RUN!

But Anna is frozen in place, staring at her brother, ten feet
up the wall, who now TRANSFORMS into a Werewolf. The front
door bursts open. Van Helsing charges in. Guns drawn.
                       VAN HELSING
          Anna!?

The Werewolf looks out over the cases, sees Van Helsing enter
the room. The Werewolf throws itself through the balcony
doors. Shattered glass and rain scatter around Anna as Van
Helsing runs up.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT’D)
          Are you alright?

She's too shocked to answer. He races out onto the balcony
and looks down.
                                                       42.



EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - NIGHT

The Werewolf scampers horizontally across the side of the
manor. It leaps off, splashes down into the river and heads
into the village.

INT. VALERIOUS ARMORY - NIGHT

The armory door crashes open. Van Helsing spins back into the
room. It's Carl. He sniffs the air.

                    CARL
          Why does it smell like wet dog in
          here?

Van Helsing holsters his revolvers and strides for the door.
                       VAN HELSING
          Werewolf

                    CARL
          Ah! Right. You'll be needing silver
          bullets then.

Carl scrounges around in his frock and pulls out a bandolier
filled with gleaming SILVER BULLETS. He tosses it to Van
Helsing, who catches it and slings it over his shoulder. Anna
snaps out of her shock and runs after Van Helsing.
                       ANNA
          No. Wait!

Van Helsing slams the door shut behind him. We hear something
slam onto the opposite side. Anna runs up and struggles with
the door, but it's jammed tight. She is not a happy camper.
                    ANNA (CONT’D)
          Van Helsing!

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

Van Helsing quietly stalks the labyrinthine streets of the
village, chambering rounds of silver bullets, on the hunt.
The only sound is the muffled revelry coming from pubs.

Van Helsing suddenly senses something and spins around, guns
up, scans the darkness, inhales deeply, then smiles.
                       VAN HELSING
          Wet dog.
                                                       43.



A FLASH OF FUR suddenly explodes out of a distant alley, and
then in a blur of incredible speed, dodges back and forth
across the street, from doorway to doorway, getting closer
and closer, always hidden or one step ahead of Van Helsing's
gun barrels. It vanishes into an alley twenty feet in front
of him. Van Helsing starts to back away.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT’D)
          Who's hunting who?

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Van Helsing spins around a corner and slams his back up
against a wall, waiting to be followed. Once again it's
quiet, too quiet. And then something slams into the wall
right next to him. Van Helsing whips his gun up into Top
Hat's face. The "something" that hit the wall was a coffin.
Top Hat smiles down the barrels, then tips his hat.

                    TOP HAT
          Well look at that, a perfect fit,
          what a coincidence.

He heads into the graveyard.

                    TOP HAT (CONT'D)
          I see the wolf man hasn't killed
          you.

                    VAN HELSING
          Don't worry, he's getting to it.

Van Helsing follows, guns up and ready.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          You don't seem too worried about
          him?

                    TOP HAT
          Oh, I'm no threat to him, and I'm
          the one who cleans up after him.

Top Hat sticks his shovel into a fresh grave.

                    TOP HAT (CONT’D)
          If you get my meaning.

                    VAN HELSING
          Little late to be digging graves,
          isn't it?
                                                       44.



                    TOP HAT
          Never too late to dig graves. Never
          know when you'll need a fresh one.

Van Helsing hears something and turns around, his eyes scan
the darkness. Behind him, Top Hat raises his shovel and
swings it down at Van Helsing's head. Van Helsing spins
around and grabs it just before it smashes into his face. Top
Hat is terrified. Van Helsing is furious. Then Top Hat's eyes
swivel just a hair. Van Helsing sees it and ducks. The blur
of fur is exploding out of the darkness behind him.

Top Hat takes the full impact of the beast and is launched
sixty feet down the alley. He's dead even before he and the
Werewolf hit the light-post.

Van Helsing whirls around. Sees the dazed Werewolf stagger to
it's feet. Van Helsing's guns come up. He has the creature in
his sights. He squeezes the triggers.
                    ANNA (O.S.)
          NO!

Anna comes out of nowhere and knocks the guns up. They FIRE.
Blasting the light on the light-post. The Werewolf hauls-ass
around a corner. Van Helsing charges after it, races around
the corner in time to see the Werewolf dart off into the dark
forest. Anna runs up beside him. Van Helsing rums, grabs her
by the throat, and pins her to a wall, furious.
                    VAN HELSING
          Why?

His grip is so tight she can't breath.

                    ANNA
          You're ... you're choking me.

He loosens his grip only slightly.

                    VAN HELSING
          Give me a reason not to.

Anna stares at him, the look in his eyes terrifies her, but
she still won't reveal what she knows.

                    ANNA
          I can't .... If people knew ...

Van Helsing stares at her, then he lets her go. Anna grabs
her throat and sucks air. As his fury abates, Van Helsing
looks back at Anna.
                                                       45.



                    VAN HELSING
          He's not your brother anymore,
          Anna.

Anna looks at him, surprised.
                       ANNA
          You knew?
                       VAN HELSING
          I guessed.

                    ANNA
          Before or after I stopped you from
          shooting him?
                       VAN HELSING
          Before.

Now it's Anna's turn to be furious.

                    ANNA
          And still you tried to kill him?

                    VAN HELSING
          He's a werewolf He's going to kill
          people.

                    ANNA
          He can't help it. It's not his
          fault!

                    VAN HELSING
          I know, but he'll do it anyway.

                    ANNA
          Do you understand forgiveness?

                    VAN HELSING
          I ask for it often.

                    ANNA
          They say Dracula has a cure. If
          there's a chance I can save my
          brother, I'm going after it.

She starts to storm off. Van Helsing's arm shoots out and
stops her.

                    VAN HELSING
          I need to find Dracula.
                                                       46.



                    ANNA
          And I need to find my brother! He
          gave his life for me! He's the only
          family I have left!

Anna looks at him, tears in her eyes, heartbroken.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          I despise Dracula more than you can
          ever imagine, he has taken
          everything from me, leaving me
          alone in this world.

She slumps back against the wall, drained. Van Helsing's face
softens, an understanding coming to him.

                    VAN HELSING
          To have memories of those you loved
          and lost, is perhaps harder than to
          have no memories at all.

He shakes his head with a sigh, then lowers his arm.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          All right, let's look for your
          brother.

EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

Strangled by a thick mesh of vines and creepers, Castle
Frankenstein has somehow grown even more ominous over the
last six months. The sky swirls with dense clouds. Lightning
flashes. Thunder cracks. But inside, all is dark and quiet.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

A little, gloved Dwerger HAND slams a huge switch down. The
laboratory sparks to life. Brilliant arcs of electricity
shoot up and down the walls. The massive dynamos, generators,
gears, and fan belts kick in. The Dwergi are feverishly
preparing the equipment. A flash of lightning attracts
Dracula to the shattered skylight.
                    DRACULA
          Igor!

Igor looks down from the skylight, rain lashing his twisted
little body, heavy wind practically blowing him off his feet.

                    IGOR
          Yes, Master?!
                                                       47.



                    DRACULA
          Have you finished?

                    IGOR
          Yes, all is done! We're coming down
          to make the final attachments!
                    DRACULA
          Good.

The Werewolf glides in through a fissure in me granite wall,
its eyes fixed on Dracula. Dracula purposefully ignores it.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Werewolves are such a nuisance
          during their first full moon, so
          hard to control.

The Werewolf TRANSFORMS back into Velkan, bent over in agony.
Dracula strides majestically past him.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          I send you on a simple errand, to
          find out who our new friend is, and
          you stop for a talk with your
          sister.

                    VELKAN
          Leave her out of this, Count! She
          doesn't know your secret, and I am
          soon to take it to my grave.

Dracula steps up to a filthy iron POD, form-fitted for a very
large human body. Inside the pod is a BURNT CORPSE.

                    DRACULA
          Don't wish for death so quickly. I
          intend for you to be quite useful.

                    VELKAN
          I would rather die than help you.

                     DRACULA
          Don't be boring, everyone who says
          that dies.

Dracula unfastens the metal straps holding the corpse in.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Besides, tonight, after the final
          stroke of midnight, you'll have no
          choice but to obey me.
                                                       48.



He rips the corpse out of the pod and throws it down in front
of Velkan.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Look familiar?

Velkan stares at it, stricken.
                    VELKAN
          Father.

Dracula grabs Velkan, lifts him up off his feet and slams him
into the pod. Igor barks orders at several of the Dwergi and
they quickly strap Velkan tight to the pod.

                    DRACULA
          He proved useless. But I'm hoping
          with Werewolf venom running through
          your veins, you will be of greater
          benefit.

Dracula grabs a rusty metal SKULLCAP and slams it down onto
Velkan's head. Wires and electrodes spring from the skullcap
and attach to the dynamos. Velkan struggles to the last.

                    VELKAN
          I may have failed to kill you,
          Count, but my sister will not!

EXT. FOREST/CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna are trotting their horses down a snowy
country lane, eyes scanning the forest and the road.

                    ANNA
          For me, this is all personal, it's
          about family and honor.

She looks over at Van Helsing, curious.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          Why do you do it? This job of
          yours, what do you hope to get out
          of it?

                    VAN HELSING
          I don't know, maybe some self-
          realization.

                    ANNA
          What have you got out of it so far?
                                                       49.


                    VAN HELSING
              (thinks hard)
          ... back pains.

Anna smiles. Van Helsing smiles back. And that's when they
both spot something on the ground. They halt their horses,
leap off and run to a spot on the road. Anna beats him to it,
her hand lifts up a long coarse hair.

                    ANNA
          Werewolves only shed before their
          first full moon. Before the curse
          has completely consumed them ...

They look off into the distance. Castle Frankenstein looms
over the countryside lit up by lightning from without and
huge arcs of electricity from within. Van Helsing and Anna
quickly pull their horses towards a decrepit old barn next to
the castle.

                    ANNA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I don't understand, the man who
          lived here was killed a year ago
          along with a hideous creature he
          created.

                    VAN HELSING (O.S.)
          That's when your father went
          missing.
                    ANNA (O.S.)
          Just after that.

They strap their horses to a post, then step across the snow
and up to the edge of the barn. Lightning flashes as they
look out at the castle past the battered front gate to the
spectacular arcs of electricity flashing out of the windows.

                    VAN HELSING
          Vampires, werewolves, lightning in
          winter, this truly is a nightmarish
          place.

Anna just stares out at the hideous castle.

                    ANNA
          I've never been to the sea.

Van Helsing looks at her, she doesn't return the look, lost
in thought, wistful.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          I'll bet it's beautiful.
                                                       50.



Van Helsing feels for her. Anna starts for the front door,
Van Helsing grabs her and pulls her back.

                    VAN HELSING
          There are those who go in through
          the front door ...

He gestures as a flash of lightning reveals a dozen corpses
tangled in the foliage around the front door.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          ... and there are those who get to
          live just a little bit longer.

He pulls her off towards the back of the castle.

INT. GOTHIC FOYER - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna creep down a huge Gothic foyer, their
boots quietly splash through brackish water covering the
floor. Suddenly, at the far end of the hall, something small
scurries past. Van Helsing lifts his shotgun tight to his
shoulder. Anna nods knowingly.
                     ANNA
          Dwerger.
                     VAN HELSING
          Dwerger?

                    ANNA
          One of Dracula's servants. If you
          get the chance to kill one, do it,
          because they'd do worse to you.
                     VAN HELSING
          Right.

Another little Dwerger steps into view. Van Helsing lowers
his shotgun to hip height. The Dwerger YELLS IN ROMANIAN up
to someone above him. Anna turns to Van Helsing, stricken.

                    ANNA
          They're using my brother for some
          sort of experiment.
                     VAN HELSING
          Anna.
                                                          51.


                    ANNA
              (desperate)
          My brother is still battling the
          sickness within him. There's still
          hope.

Van Helsing grabs her, hushed:

                    VAN HELSING
          Anna! There is no hope for your
          brother, bur we can still protect
          others by killing Dracula.

She stares at him, filled with fury and desperation and
sorrow. Van Helsing's sympathetic eyes pierce into her.
Thunder rumbles.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES as the Dwergi move like monkeys around all
the equipment. Everything is starting to accelerate. Dynamos
CRACKLE. Pulleys WHIRL. Electrical arcs FLASH. Dracula turns
a flywheel. The pod with Velkan inside it rises up off the
floor, heading for the skylight high above.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

As Van Helsing and Anna come around a huge stone column their
faces fill with disgust. Hanging from the ceiling, rafters,
and beams are dozens of gooey white maggot-like COCOONS,
about the size of watermelons. DRIPPING SLIME.

                    VAN HELSING
          You ever see these before?
Anna shakes her head, revolted.

                    ANNA
          What do you think they are?

Van Helsing steps up to one and ponders it.
                       VAN HELSING
          Offspring.
                       ANNA
          What?

                    VAN HELSING
          A man, with three gorgeous women,
          for four hundreds years?
                                                       52.



He looks at Anna and cocks an eyebrow. Anna is shocked, she
looks out over the cocoons.

                    ANNA
          Vampires are the walking dead, it
          only makes sense that their
          children are born dead.

Van Helsing checks out an electric wire sticking into the
cocoon, then notices wires sticking out of all the cocoons.

                    VAN HELSING
          He must be trying to find a way to
          bring them to life.

All the wires wend their way up the massive stairs and into
the flickering laboratory far above.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          I was told Dracula and his Brides
          only kill one or two people a
          month.

He snaps open his shotgun and smashes open a box of SHELLS.
TIGHT on the box of shells MARKED: SILVER NITRATE.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          If they bring all of these things
          to life ...

He lets the thought finish itself and starts pumping shells
into the shotgun.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula steps up to a huge vat of neon green liquid, he slams
the hatch shut and dogs it tight.
                    DRACULA
          Let us begin!

Igor and the Dwergi lower blast shields over their heads,
then clamber up the towering scaffolding to various power
stations. The weather is getting ferocious. Gusts of RAIN
whip down from the shattered skylight, backlit by blinding
LIGHTNING and accompanied by explosive THUNDER.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Van Helsing's fingers dig into one of the cocoons. He pulls
out a handful of the dreadful white goo and flings it to the
floor. He goes for another handful.
                                                       53.



INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula spins around into a CLOSE UP:

                    DRACULA
          Throw the switches!

EXT. CASTLE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod, then
courses through Velkan's body. Mercifully, we can't hear him
scream because one of the straps covers his mouth. A flash of
energy shoots down wires and into the castle.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

The flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires and
starts them jumping like scalded snakes. Van Helsing watches
this, then continues digging a hole in the cocoon, his hand
suddenly reveals the repulsive little humanoid face of a
PYGMY BAT. It has huge, creepy, lidless eyeballs covered in
veins, a hairy pig snout, mottled greenish skin, and a gaping
maw filled with rows of tiny, razor-sharp fangs. Even with
it's eyes open it's obviously lifeless. Anna looks sickened.

Another flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires.
And that's when the creepy little thing SNAPS TO LIFE and
HISSES. Anna SCREAMS. Van Helsing palms her mouth and pulls
her tight. All the cocoons begin PULSING with some sort of
repulsive inner life.

High above, Dracula, Verona, and Aleera stride out of the
flickering electrical light show and onto a balcony.

Van Helsing and Anna quickly back off into the darkness. A
third flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires. All
the cocoons begin QUIVERING WILDLY, shocked into animation.

The pygmy bat revealed by Van Helsing suddenly EXPLODES out
of it's cocoon. It darts up into the rafters. More cocoons
explode open, spraying walls and pillars with gooey white
slime. The putrid little things fly around the foyer. Their
CHITTERING becomes deafening. Dracula smiles at his Brides.

                    DRACULA
          They must feed. Show them how.

Dracula shoves Aleera and Verona off the balcony.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          And beg the devil that this time
          they stay alive!
                                                       54.



The two Brides drop through the air and then TRANSFORM into
giant bat form. They fly and cavort with their offspring.
Dracula points out the windows and YELLS to his spawn:

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          You must feed! To the village! TO
          THE VILLAGE!

Van Helsing whirls out into the foyer.

                    VAN HELSING
          This is where I come in.

                    ANNA
          No! Wait! You can't!

All the windows in the foyer suddenly SHATTER as the brides
and their winged vermin start to fly through them.

And that's when Van Helsing OPENS FIRE. Pumping controlled
bursts, the silver nitrate flashing weirdly. Several of the
hideous things are hit. They BURST INTO BLACK GOO.

Dracula looks down, insanely furious, all he can see is the
silhouette of a man in the foyer far below him. Van Helsing
slams his shotgun into a holster strapped across his back.

                    VAN HELSING
          Now that I have your attention.

Needless to say, Dracula goes nuts. He screams in rage and
leaps off the eighty-foot-high balcony. Van Helsing sprints
hell-bent-for-leather back down the foyer. We don't get to
see what Dracula has transformed into, but the sound and fury
of his wings is tremendous, creating a huge wind that throws
everything around and almost knocks Anna off her feet as she
leaps our from behind a stone column and races up the
staircase, heading for the laboratory.

INT. TOWER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Valerious tower bedroom looks like it's been ransacked by
a librarian. Ancient artifacts, strange relics, and spiritual
texts are arranged symmetrically around a huge CANOPY BED. A
flicker of lightning illuminates Carl, wide-eyed as he reads
from an elaborately inscribed SACRED LATIN TEXT.

                    CARL
          Well, that's interesting....
                                                          55.



And then he hears a horrible CHITTERING. Carl runs to a
window and looks out. From this distance, it looks like
flying monkeys winging their way over the dark countryside.
Carl stares in horror, then turns and runs out of the room.

INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN FOYER - NIGHT

Back in the foyer, the sound and fury and wind dissipate.
Then WE CUT TO Dracula's POV, a creepy blueish NIGHT-VISION,
scanning the foyer. Van Helsing is nowhere in sight. WE TRACK
a huge WINGED SHADOW across a wall, it transforms into the
shadow of a man. Dracula steps into FRAME.

                    DRACULA
          I can tell the character of a man
          by the sound of his heartbeat.

He puts his hand to his ear, we can hear the sound of a
HEARTBEAT.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Usually when I approach I can
          almost dance to the beat....
          Strange that yours is so steady.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna withdraws her sabre as she creeps into the laboratory.
The Dwergi are frantically scurrying about. Igor yells above
the cacophony of the machinery and the weather.

                    IGOR
          We're losing power! The human is
          insufficient! Accelerate the
          generators! Power the dynamos!

Anna notices the pod high above the shattered skylight.
Another bolt of lightning strikes it. One of Velkan's arms
suddenly breaks loose from the straps and flails wildly.
                    ANNA
          Velkan.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

Several men and a comely BARMAID dash out of a pub and join
dozens of other peasants into the square, staring up into the
storm racked skies at the approaching winged vermin.

                    BARMAID
          Oh my God. What do we do? What do
          we do?
                                                          56.



Carl comes racing around the corner.
                       CARL
          RUUUN!!

He grabs the Barmaid and yanks her out of frame as the
hideous creatures flock down into the square. Everybody runs
like hell. Some people are ripped up off their feet and
carried into the air, others are gang tackled and mauled by
the creatures. It's like a scene out of The Birds.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Dracula stalks through the arches. A phosphorescent match
suddenly IGNITES at his feet, he looks down. Van Helsing
drops out of a ceiling and STABS a wooden stake deep into his
chest. Dracula looks at the wooden stake in his chest, then
at Van Helsing, standing in a shaft of light. Dracula gives
him a rather pleasant smile.
                    DRACULA
          Hello, Gabriel.

Van Helsing freezes. We've never seen him puzzled before.
Dracula calmly grabs the wooden stake in his chest, rips it
out and casually discards it.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna creeps across a catwalk, suddenly, she hears the SCREAM
of charging Dwergi, one to the left, one to the right. Anna
clamps her sword between her teeth and leaps out onto a
hanging rope. The two Dwergi leap out after her. All three of
them climb. The Dwergi getting closer and closer to Anna. One
of them grabs her boot. Anna grabs her sword and lashes down,
cutting the rope, both Dwergi plummet down into a vat of
boiling green liquid.

Igor and the other Dwergi are too busy to have noticed.

                    IGOR
          We must not lose the Master's
          progeny!

Anna sockets her sabre and keeps climbing.

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

Flying serenely above the scream-filled village, Verona’s
hideous fanged mouth smiles adoringly.

                    VERONA
          Feed my lovelies! FEED!
                                                       57.



She lifts up a terrified man, dangling from her hand, then
chucks him out over the village. A swarm of pygmy bats swoops
in like piranha, grabbing him and tearing him apart.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

A dawning realization washes over Dracula.

                    DRACULA
          You don't remember, do you?

Suspicious, Van Helsing backs off into the ancient foyer.

                    VAN HELSING
          Exactly what should I be
          remembering?

Dracula follows him, like a cat toying with a trapped mouse.

                    DRACULA
          You are the great Van Helsing.
          Trained by monks and mullahs from
          Tibet to Istanbul. Protected by
          Rome herself! But like me...
              (his face darkens)
          ...hunted by all others.

                    VAN HELSING
          The Knights of the Holy Order know
          all about you, so I guess it's no
          surprise that you would know about
          me.

                    DRACULA
          Oh, but it's much more than that,
          you and I go back a long way,
          Gabriel. I know why you have such
          horrible nightmares. The horrific
          scenes of ancient battles past? Do
          you know how you received those
          triangular scars on your back?

Van Helsing's eyes narrow, now it's getting really strange.

                    VAN HELSING
          ... how do you know me?

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna runs up to Velkan, who is still strapped into the pod.
She starts unbuckling the belts. Velkan's delirious eyes
finally notice her, a sudden clarity fills them, he starts
shaking his head and shoving her away with his free arm.
                                                        58.



                    ANNA
          Stop, Velkan! Stop it! It's all
          right. I've come to save you.

The CLOCK TOWER behind them begins to CHIME MIDNIGHT.
Velkan's hand grabs Anna’s mouth and starts to grow coarse
hair and horrific claws. Anna’s eyes practically bug out of
her head. She SCREAMS and tries to rip herself away.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Van Helsing hears Anna's scream. Dracula just smiles.

                    DRACULA
          So, would you like me to refresh
          your memory? A few details from
          your sordid past?

Van Helsing rips a crucifix out of his cloak and thrusts it
at Dracula. Dracula SHRIEKS and angrily swats it away, then
calms down, smiling beatifically, as if nothing, had
happened.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          I guess that's a conversation for
          another time. But before you go,
          let me reintroduce myself
              (bows majestically)
          Count Vladislaus Dragulia. Born
          1432. Murdered 1462.

His bicuspids distend into razor sharp fangs.

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

A third-story window bursts into shards of glass as a woman
leaps through it. Two pygmy bats fly out of the window behind
her and grab her inches before she hits the pavement.

Carl and the Barmaid come racing around a corner just as the
woman is flown up over their heads. Carl lets go of the
Barmaid and jumps up to try and save the woman, but she's too
high and the hideous vermin carry her off. And that's when
Carl hears a scream. He turns and looks.

The Barmaid is clinging to a light post six feet off the
ground, her legs are being yanked up by a pygmy bat. Carl
grabs a chair on the run and swings it into the creature. The
hideous thing is knocked away. The Barmaid drops into Carl's
arms. The creature quickly recovers and charges back for Carl
and the Barmaid. The Barmaid screams. Carl screams.
                                                       59.


The creature suddenly pulls up two feet short of killing
them, the look on its hideous face has gone from blood-lust
to panic, it frantically claws at its body and then BURSTS
INTO MOLTEN FLESH ROT.

HIGH ABOVE THE SQUARE: all of the pygmy bats BURST INTO
MOLTEN FLESH ROT. Several people are dropped to their deaths.

The two flying Brides freak out and start to SHRIEK.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Dracula spins around at the distant sound of his brides
WAILING. Van Helsing uses the moment to leap into a large
dumbwaiter and cut the cables with one of his saw blades.
Dracula looks back in time to see Van Helsing rocket upwards.

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Anna SCREAMS. Velkan looks at his hands,
eyes widening in horror, he gives his sister one last
pathetic look, and then TRANSFORMS into the Werewolf. Anna
quickly backs away and slams into another body. She screams
and spins around. It's Van Helsing.

                    VAN HELSING
          I think we've overstayed our
          welcome.

The fat gun in his hand FIRES. The tether shoots off across
the castle moat and slams into the top of a huge oak tree two
hundred yards away. Van Helsing quickly ties his end taut.

As the clock CHIMES, the Werewolf sits up in front of it.
Viciously tearing his way free, he heads for our two heroes.

Van Helsing scoops Anna up off her feet and leaps over the
wall just as the Werewolf rips the shotgun off his back.

Van Helsing and Anna start to rappel down the tether. The
Werewolf slashes it, severing it. Van Helsing and Anna are
suddenly swinging out over the moat and into the dark forest.

The Werewolf glares after them, filled with an incredible
fury as the clock hits the final stroke of midnight....

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

Carl and the Barmaid look around, confused.
                    BARMAID
          What happened?
                                                         60.



                    CARL
          They... they just died.

The Barmaid wraps her arms around Carl and kisses him of the
cheek.

                    BARMAID
          How can I ever repay you?

Carl whispers into her ear. The Barmaid looks shocked.

                    BARMAID (CONT'D)
          But you can't do that, you're a
          monk.

                    CARL
          Actually, I'm just a friar....

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

High atop the castle tower, Dracula cradles the sobbing
brides in his arms. Igor slithers up, looking terrified, if
he had a tail, it would be tucked firmly between his legs.

                    IGOR
          I am sorry, Master. We try and we
          try, but I fear we are not so smart
          as Doctor Frankenstein.

Dracula turns to him.
                    DRACULA
          Truly.

Igor cowers, but Dracula seems spent.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          It is clear that the good Doctor
          took the key to life to his grave.
The Werewolf steps up onto the parapet, an insane look in
it's eyes. Dracula waves him away, dismissive.
                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Hunt them down. Kill them both.

The Werewolf gives him a deranged look and snarls evilly,
clearly he is Velkan Valerio us no more. He turns and leaps
off the parapet.
                                                        61.



EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

RAIN lashes down on Van Helsing and Anna as they stagger
across the moors, heading into the ruins of the old windmill.
With the loss of her brother, Anna doesn't know whether to
scream or cry, so she does both, and aims it at Van Helsing.

                    ANNA
          A wooden stake?! A silver
          crucifix?! What did you think?! We
          haven't tried everything before?

Anna shoves Van Helsing back under one of the huge charred
windmill sails, a refuge from the rain.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          We've been hunting this creature
          for more than four hundred years.
          We've shot him, stabbed him,
          clubbed him, sprayed him with holy
          water and staked him in the heart,
          and still he lives!

Van Helsing just stares at her, fire fascinates him, fiery
women even more so. She gets right up into his face.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          Do you understand?... Nobody knows
          how to kill Dracula.

Their faces are inches apart. RAIN pours down on them. A
slight smile creases Van Helsing's lips.

                    VAN HELSING
          I could've used that information a
          little earlier.

Anna just scowls, breathing hard. Van Helsing's dark eyes
stare at her, he likes being this close to her. But she's too
upset.

                    ANNA
          Don't give me that look. I don't
          need your wolf's eyes undressing
          me...

She shoves herself away and stares off into the rain.

                    ANNA (CONT’D)
          ... not right now anyway.

Van Helsing picks up an undamaged absinthe bottle and admires
it. Anna looks at him, the fight going out of her.
                                                       62.



                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          You were right ... I'm sorry ... he
          isn't my brother anymore.

She steps up closer to him as he uncorks the bottle.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          Do you have any family, Mister Van
          Helsing?

                    VAN HELSING
          I'm not sure. I hope to find out
          someday, that's what keeps me
          going.

Anna takes the bottle and holds it up in a toast.

                    ANNA
          Here's to what keeps you going.

She takes a deep slug, clearly it has a bite.
                    VAN HELSING
          Absinthe. Strong stuff

Anna hands him the bottle.

                    ANNA
          Yes. Don't let it touch your
          tongue, it'll knock you on your-

-And that's when the soggy ground beneath them suddenly CAVES
IN. The two of them and a load of timber drop into a rapidly
expanding breach in the ground.

INT. CAVERN - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna and a cascade of water and timber crash
down into a cavern and WE FADE OUT....

EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

FADE UP: on the Transylvanian village at dawn.

INT. TOWER BEDROOM - DAY

Carl is asleep on a couch. He suddenly sits up, terrified,
then looks down and sees the sleeping Barmaid.

                    CARL
          Ah! Yes ... now I remember.
                                                       63.



Carl leans back against the wall, triggering a secret panel
to swing open and reveal a PAINTING: a fantastic mural of two
medieval KNIGHTS facing each other atop a sea lashed cliff.
There is writing in Latin encircled around the two men. Carl
translates it:

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Even a man who is pure in heart,
          and says his prayers by night, may
          become a wolf when the wolf-bane
          blooms, and the moon is shining
          bright.

He steps up to get a closer look and finish the inscription.

                     CARL (CONT'D)
          Or crave another's blood when the
          sun goes down, and his body takes
          to flight.

As soon as he finishes the last word, the entire painting
COMES ALIVE, trees sway, grass blows, huge waves pound the
cliff, the clock on a church tower begins to CHIME, and the
two knights TRANSFORM: one into a Werewolf, the other into a
Winged Beast from Hell. They viciously attack each other.

Carl of course freaks out, stumbles back, knocks the entire
couch over and lands on the Barmaid's semi-naked body. She
angrily shoves him off as he looks up at the painting. The
ancient painting is back to being just a painting, as if it
was all in his mind. He stares at it, perplexed, as his
Transylvanian girlfriend angrily gathers her clothes.

                    BARMAID
          Friars, monks, priests, you're all
          the same!

INT. CAVERN - DAY

Anna slowly wakes up on the dark cavern floor, groggy and
sore, she rubs her head and groans. A HAND quickly covers her
mouth. She looks up. Van Helsing's finger goes to his lips.

                    VAN HELSING
          Shhh ... there's something down
          here.

And it's carnivorous.

He gestures to a massive pile of RAT BONES, picked clean.

Anna gets to her feet. The cavern is lit by a very dim gloom
coming from tiny crevices in the roof.
                                                       64.


A fetid little stream wends its way through the cavern. Van
Helsing starts to head downstream. Anna draws her sword and
follows.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Whatever's down here appears to be
          of human ancestry.

He gestures to a large set of muddy BOOT PRINTS.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          I'd say he's a size 17. About 360
          pounds. 8 1/2 to 9 feet tall. He
          has a bad gimp in his right leg....
          And three copper teeth.

                    ANNA
          How do you know he has copper
          teeth?

                    VAN HELSING
          Because he's standing right behind
          you.

Van Helsing goes for his guns. Frankenstein's Monster leaps
out of the pitch blackness behind Anna and slams her into Van
Helsing. Our two heroes crash to the floor. Van Helsing's
revolver goes flying.

The monster is on Van Helsing in a flash he lifts him up over
his head and hurtles him into a rock wall. Van Helsing
bounces off the wall and slams to the floor. The monster
looks down at Anna. Anna gets a good look at him. He now
looks even more horrific than before, having been badly
burned so long ago.

                    ANNA
          Oh my god, the Frankenstein
          monster.
                      FRANKENSTEIN
          MONSTER!?

Frankenstein's VOICE is a horrible, guttural rasp.
                    FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Who is the monster here?!?

He lifts Anna up off the floor.
                    FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          I have done nothing wrong and yet
          you and your kind all wish me dead!
                                                       65.



Van Helsing leaps up and tackles Frankenstein. Frankenstein's
head slams into a rock wall, the top half of his head pops
off. Van Helsing grabs him by the neck, the bolts SPARK, Van
Helsing is shocked back against the far wall, he crashes to
the floor, trying not to pass out from the pain.

Frankenstein slams the top of his head back into place, then
the top half of his body turns around and he heads for Anna.
Anna backs away, up against some burnt timber, looking
around, playing for time.

                    ANNA
          What do you want?

Frankenstein stares down at her, his face growing mournful.
                      FRANKENSTEIN
          To exist.

Van Helsing yanks an ivory BLOWGUN out from inside his cloak
and sticks it to his mouth.

Six blow-darts nail Frankenstein in the back. He bellows and
spins around, arms flailing at his back, trying to swat the
darts free. Anna runs over and picks up one of the revolvers
off the ground next to Van Helsing.

                    ANNA
          We must kill it.

Van Helsing grabs her by the wrist.
                      VAN HELSING
          No! Wait.

Frankenstein crashes to his knees, his bleary eyes look over
at them.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          If you value your lives, and the
          lives of your kind, you will kill
          me.

Van Helsing pulls Anna behind him and heads for Frankenstein,
whose breathing is getting more and more labored.

                    FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          If Dracula finds me I am the key to
          my father's machine the key to
          life, life for Dracula's children!
                                                       66.



                    VAN HELSING
          He already awakened them, last
          night.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Those were just from one bride,
          from one single birthing. And they
          died as they did the last time he
          tried. Only with me can he give
          them lasting life.

Van Helsing kneels down beside Frankenstein.

                    VAN HELSING
          There are more? More of those
          things?

Frankenstein's pathetic eyes stare at him.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Thousands ... thousands more.

Frankenstein passes out, crashing face first into the dirt.
WE PUSH IN on Van Helsing as the gravity of this hits him.
Anna isn't fazed, she lifts the gun and aims. Van Helsing
steps in front of her. She angrily looks him in the eyes.

                    ANNA
          You heard what he said.

Van Helsing holds her stare, searching for the words ....

                    VAN HELSING
          My life, my ... job ... is to
          vanquish evil. I can sense evil.
              (gestures to Frankenstein)
          This thing ... man ... whatever it
          is, evil may have created it, left
          its mark on it, but evil does not
          rule it. So I cannot kill it.
                    ANNA
          I can.

She moves around him. He blocks her path.
                    VAN HELSING
          Not while I'm here.

Anna sees the intensity in his eyes. Behind them, hidden in
the shadows, is the Werewolf, staring at Frankenstein.
                                                        67.



                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Your family has spent four hundred
          years trying to kill Dracula, maybe
          this poor creature can help us find
          a way.

The Werewolf slowly starts to back away. Van Helsing suddenly
senses it and spins around. He and Anna see the Werewolf's
shadow vanish down the cavern.

                     ANNA
          Oh my God. He's seen us.
              (she turns to Van Helsing)
          Now they'll come for him. And
          neither you or I will be able to
          stop them.

Van Helsing grabs her arm and heads for Frankenstein.

                    VAN HELSING
          I must get him to Rome. We can
          protect him there.

On Anna's dubious look WE SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - DAY

STEAM blasts out of the nostrils of huge black horses,
covered in a light armor plating, coupled to an ornate COACH.
Van Helsing and Carl walk down alongside them.

                    CARL
          ... and then the painting came
          alive and the two creatures
          attacked each other.
                    VAN HELSING
          What does it mean?

                    CARL
          I don't know.

Anna opens the door to the coach. Frankenstein is inside,
chained to the back wall. Van Helsing nudges Carl.

                    VAN HELSING
          Whatever you do, don't stare at
          him.
                                                       68.



                    CARL
          I'm staring at him.
              (quickly turns away)
          Is that a man?

Van Helsing shoves Carl up into the seat across from
Frankenstein.

                    VAN HELSING
          Actually it's seven men, parts of
          them anyway.

Frankenstein struggles to break the chains that bind him.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          By exposing me, you have condemned
          me. Me and all of humanity!

Anna slams the door shut and gestures to the horses.

                    ANNA
          Nothing is faster than
          Transylvanian steeds. Not even a
          werewolf Anything else, you're on
          your own.

COUNTRYSIDE - DAY/NIGHT TRANSITION

On the bottom half of the SCREEN, the coach races across the
countryside. On the top half, the sky is whipping past in
TIME LAPSE. Dark clouds scream by showing us glimpses of the
sun as it races right to left across the SCREEN. As the sun
exits FRAME the moon comes up and the TIME LAPSE ends
revealing an ominous night sky. The coach races into a dark
forest. Two Bride silhouettes fly past and follow it.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

The black steeds charge through the woods pulling the COACH.
Van Helsing is in the driver's seat urging them on.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Frankenstein stomps his Doc Martens and yells out.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Free me! Let me fight! Let me die!
          But do not let me be taken alive!

Sitting across from him is Carl, eyes wide, really keyed up,
the blowgun stuck to his lips.
                                                       69.



EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

The CAMERA is suddenly hurtling through the misty forest at
about Mach 1. The BRIDE'S POV quickly closes in on the coach.

Van Helsing senses them coming, he looks around, the creepy
trees sway in the breeze, but he can't see the brides. He
hefts the crossbow. He hears something off to his left and
looks. And that's when Verona swoops down on his right and
grabs him jerking him clean off the driver's seat and up into
the air. The crossbow goes flying. Van Helsing quickly breaks
free and falls down onto the lead horse. He looks forward.

A hundred yards ahead, the path makes a hairpin turn next to
a giant precipice. Van Helsing quickly looks back at the
coach.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

The coach bounces hard. Frankenstein is thrown forward at
Carl. Carl screams, but the chains hold Frankenstein just
short of falling on him.
                       FRANKENSTEIN
          Let me go.

                    CARL
          Where are you going to go? I don't
          know if you've looked in the mirror
          lately, but you kind of stick our
          in a crowd.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Van Helsing leaps from the front horse to the middle horse to
the rear horse and then up onto the buckboard. And that's
when Aleera nails him on the fly, throwing him back onto the
rear horse.

All of the horses try to make the turn, going full boar,
hoofs fighting to avoid slipping over the edge, kicking rocks
our into space. Van Helsing holds on for dear life. The coach
skids sideways, the couplings SNAP and the coach is flung out
over the void.

Van Helsing spins up into a saddle in time to see the coach
spiraling through the air, heading for the valley floor far
below.

EXT. IN THE AIR - NIGHT

HIGH UP IN THE AIR: Aleera and Verona freak out.
                                                         70.



                    VERONA
          We must not let him be destroyed!

EXT. WOODS - CLIFF FACE - NIGHT

The two Brides fly as fast as they can towards the plummeting
coach. They both grab it, but its weight is far too great for
them to stop it from falling. Aleera is losing her grip.

                    ALEERA
          Save him! Save the monster!

Aleera is blown off Verona struggles her way to the door, her
wings are being badly buffeted. She grabs the door and rips
it off, then looks inside. The coach is empty.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

BACK WITH VAN HELSING as ANOTHER COACH races out of the
forest and up to the six team. Anna in the driver's seat.
Carl leans out the window. Frankenstein is chained inside.

                    CARL
          Come on! Come on!

INT. COACH - NIGHT
BACK INSIDE THE OTHER COACH: Verona sees a bunch of glycerine
tubes wrapped around a dozen SILVER SPIKES. Verona hisses in
anger and throws herself free of the coach.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

The coach hits the ground and EXPLODES. Several   of the spikes
nail Verona in the chest. She shrieks in horror   and then
TRANSFORMS back into herself. Losing her wings,   she drops out
of the sky, DECAYING into molten rot, shrieking   all the way.
Aleera screeches in horror.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Van Helsing leaps from the six team onto the buckboard of the
other coach, landing next to Anna. He gives Anna a nudge in
the ribs and a cocky smile, as if to say, "I told you it
would work." And that's when 800 pounds of enraged fur leaps
over the entire six team, heading right for Van Helsing and
Anna.
                                                       71.



Van Helsing quickly rolls off one way as Anna flings herself
off the other. The Werewolf slams into the buckboard and
skids sideways across the roof, shattering all four corner
lanterns. The Werewolf vanishes off the back of the coach as
the kerosene and the entire roof bursts into flames.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl frantically looks around, then sees Anna's face
plastered to the window.
                     ANNA
          CARL!

Carl leaps over and opens the door.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Anna is hanging on to the side of the coach, which is now
skirting a huge precipice a mile deep. Carl grabs her as she
starts to slip.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COACH: Van Helsing is being
violently dragged down the road, desperately clinging by one
hand to the axle of the coach. His legs splitting the rear
wheel, if he lets go he'll be run over.
                     VAN HELSING
          CARL!

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl looks past Frankenstein to the other side of the coach.
He can't let go of Anna or she'll fall. He looks at
Frankenstein. Frankenstein nods.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
          I can help.

                    CARL
          You won't kill me?

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Only if you don't hurry.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Van Helsing grimaces in pain, his five fingers cling to the
axle, then four fingers, then three, two, one. He lets go and
heads under the rear wheel. And that's when a huge fist grabs
him by the collar and pulls him free. It's Frankenstein.
                                                          72.


The two men share a look, then Frankenstein heaves Van
Helsing upwards. He lands on the buckboard just as Anna
swings up next to him.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl looks at Frankenstein and smiles in relief, then he
screams bloody murder as he sees FUR moving across the rear
window. And then the roof splits open and fire and smoke
pours in. Now it's Frankenstein's turn to scream.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna look back through the fire towards the
rear of the coach. In SLO-MO the Werewolf rises up through
the flames.

The side door of the coach smashes open and Frankenstein and
Carl look out.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Don't look down.

                    CARL
          I'm looking down! I'm looking down!

The coach makes it across the precipice road and enters the
forest. The Werewolf hunches. Van Helsing YELLS at Anna.
                      VAN HELSING
          Jump!

Anna turns and leaps off the carriage. So does Carl and
Frankenstein. They all vanish into the lush forest.

Van Helsing aims both of his guns down at the coupling and
fires. The horses break loose of the carriage. Van Helsing
turns and jumps. The Werewolf leaps through the flames.

Van Helsing spins around in mid-air and fires his guns back
at the Werewolf just as it tackles him. They vanish into the
foliage. The flaming coach flips off the road, spirals
through the air and crashes into the trees. The six team
hauls-ass down the forest road, vanishing into the night ....

~ - -=--=:.-      .~ - ~ ------

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Anna staggers through the forest, she rounds a tree, her
breath hitches. Lying naked on the ground is her brother. He
looks up and gives his sister one last sorrowful look.
                                                       73.


                    VELKAN
          Forgive me.

And then he dies. Anna throws herself onto Velkan's body.

                    ANNA
          Velkan! ... Velkan! ... Velkan.

She cradles him gently and kisses him on the cheek.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          I will see you again.

Nearby, Van Helsing staggers to his feet. Anna looks at him,
then leaps up and charges him, pummeling him with her fists.

                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          You killed him! You killed him!

Van Helsing grabs her by the wrists and holds her tight.

                    VAN HELSING
          Now you know why they call me
          murderer.

Anna looks into his eyes, they are not angry, but filled with
a profound sadness. And then Anna notices BLOOD on his shirt,
she gently opens his cloak. Anna gasps. Horrified.

                    ANNA
          Oh my god ...

Van Helsing's shirt is punctured with bloody fang holes.
                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          You've been bitten.
She staggers back and looks at him, she sees it in his eyes.
A hint of it anyway. Fear. Van Helsing turns and looks down
at Velkan's body. Anna turns away. Aleera is standing right
there. She backhands Anna.

Anna slams into a tree and drops to the ground, our cold. Van
Helsing spins around in time to catch a glimpse of Anna,
upside down, being yanked up into the trees. Van Helsing
hauls-ass.
                                                       74.



EXT. CLIFFSIDE - NIGHT

Van Helsing runs out onto the side of a cliff. He sees Anna
being carried off over the precipice by Aleera. Carl and
Frankenstein stagger up beside him. All three of them watch
the silhouettes of Anna and Aleera flying off towards the
lights of a distant city ....

EXT. BUDAPEST - DAY

Nestled in a lush valley and split in half by a dark river,
the city is sprinkled with churches, mosques, and palaces.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Van Helsing, Carl, and Frankenstein stagger down an alley.
Battered and bruised. Frankenstein's face is covered by a
hood. Van Helsing pulls his cloak tight, keeping his wound
hidden. A blast of wind hits them. They all react, Van
Helsing flinches in pain as he pulls his gun.

Perched on the snowy eve of a house is Aleera, she clicks her
tongue in disapproval.

                    ALEERA
          Tch, tch, tch, so much trouble to
          my Master, so much trouble.

Frankenstein starts to head for her. Van Helsing stays him.
Aleera just giggles.

                    ALEERA (CONT'D)
          You killed Verona. If the Master
          was capable of love, he would have
          loved her very much. As for me ...
              (she smiles coquettishly)
          ... now I will have the Master's
          undivided attention.
                    VAN HELSING
          What do you want?

                    ALEERA
          The Master commands a trade. The
          monster for the Princess.

Frankenstein glares at her angrily, and then he hears Van
Helsing's VOICE:
                    VAN HELSING (O.S.)
          Somewhere public. Lots of people.
                                                       75.



Frankenstein looks at Van Helsing, feeling betrayed, his brow
furrows, his eyes darken. Van Helsing's eyes stay on Aleera.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          A place where your master will be
          less inclined to expose his ...
          other side.

Aleera chews this over for a moment, then her eyes light up.

                    ALEERA
          Tomorrow night is All Hallow's Eve!
          Here in Budapest there is a
          wonderful masquerade ball.

She leaps for joy, all the way up to the top of the roof.

                    ALEERA (CONT'D)
          I love masquerade balls!
              (she looks down at them)
          Vilkovia Palace. Midnight.

Then she whoops for joy and leaps again, vanishing over the
side of the roof, followed by a blast of wind and snow.

Van Helsing holsters his gun and rums to go, he winces in
pain. Carl sees this and reaches for Van Helsing's cloak.

                    CARL
          Are you hurt?

Van Helsing shoves his hand away. Frankenstein's eyes narrow
suspiciously, then he lunges forward and rips Van Helsing's
cloak open, revealing the puncture wounds in his shirt.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          He has been bitten! Bitten by a
          werewolf.

Van Helsing pulls his cloak tight. Frankenstein's face forms
a twisted smile.
                    FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Now you will become that which you
          have hunted so passionately.
Helsing pulls out the BLOWGUN and looks at Frankenstein.
                       VAN HELSING
          I'm sorry.

And he means it. Frankenstein just glares.
                                                       76.



                    FRANKENSTEIN
          May others be as passionate in
          their hunting of you.

Van Helsing FIRES THE DARTS.

EXT. VILKOVA PALACE GRAVEYARD - DUSK

The last shadows of the day stretch like creepy fingers
across an ancient ROYAL GRAVEYARD. Wearing costumes and
masks, Van Helsing and Carl step out of an old MAUSOLEUM.
They shove the huge stone door shut and bar it tight.

                    CARL
          According to the books, you wont
          turn into a werewolf until the
          rising of your first full moon, two
          nights from now, and then you'll
          still be able to fight Dracula's
          hold over you until the final
          stroke of midnight.

The two men make their way through the tombstones, heading
for a huge, ornate PALACE next door.
                    VAN HELSING
              (sarcastic)
          Sounds like I have nothing to worry
          about.

                    CARL
          Oh my God, you should be terrified.

Van Helsing gives him a look. Then Carl gets It.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Oh ... well, urn, that still gives
          us forty-eight hours to find a
          solution.

Carl looks back at the mausoleum.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Are you sure he can't get out of
          there?

                    VAN HELSING
          Not without some help from the
          dead.

TIGHT on a COFFIN, lying in the frozen ground, waiting to be
buried. The lid cracks open, gnarled fingers pry their way
out.
                                                         77.



INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

The grand ballroom is packed with dancing couples and alive
with JUGGLERS, FIRE BLOWERS, TIGHT ROPE WALKERS, and HIGH
WIRE ACROBATS, a veritable Cirque du Solei!' Van Helsing and
Carl make their way through all the weirdness.

                    CARL
          Well, this is different.

                    VAN HELSING
          Dracula must have something up his
          sleeve.

                     CARL
          So in situations like this, do we
          have a solid plan? Or do we just
          improvise?

                    VAN HELSING
          A bit of both actually.

They step up to the ornate banquet tables. Van Helsing
inhales deeply. Carl does likewise.

                    CARL
          Smells wonderful, doesn't it?
                    VAN HELSING
          Not everything.

                    CARL
          What do you smell?
                    VAN HELSING
          Everything.

Van Helsing looks around, suddenly very SUSPICIOUS.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Warm pretzels, juniper bushes,
          ladies perfume, and rotted human
          flesh.

Carl gives him a look.

                    CARL
          You sure do know how to put a
          damper on the evening.
                                                       78.



INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Dracula dances with Anna, both
wearing masks. He dips her and removes her mask. She is in a
trance. Eyes open, unblinking. Dracula throws away his mask
and kisses her. Anna snaps out of it. Dracula spins her
around.

                     DRACULA
          How does it feel to be a puppet on
          my string?

Anna suddenly looks around, realizing she's dancing with
Dracula. She struggles, but is completely within his power.

                    ANNA
          I wont let you trade me, Count.

                    DRACULA
          I have no intention of trading you.
          And if I know Van Helsing, which I
          do, he isn't planning on making a
          trade either.

He dips her and leans in close, their lips almost touching.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Neither of us has ever settled for
          half.

                    ANNA
          You make my skin craw!.

                    DRACULA
          That's not all I could do with your
          skin.

Dracula gently caresses her neck. Aleera cuts in and grabs
Anna away from Dracula.
                    ALEERA
          My rum.

Aleera dances away with Anna. Dracula smiles, then randomly
grabs a passing woman, yanks her close and bites into her
neck. The ballroom is in such high swing no one notices.

INT. BALLROOM - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Van Helsing and Carl look down on the
ballroom. Carl spots Aleera dancing with Anna.
                                                       79.



                    CARL
          There they are.
                    VAN HELSING
          Something's not right.

                    CARL
          Yes, they're both trying to lead.
                      VAN HELSING
          Not that.

And then Van Helsing spots something, his eyes light up.
                      VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Carl?
                      CARL
          Yes?

                     VAN HELSING
          I have a plan. I need you to do
          something.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

BACK ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Aleera dances Anna across the floor.

                    ALEERA
          It's the little things in life that
          I love. Like that last look in my
          victim's eyes just before they die.

We see in Anna's eyes how hard she's struggling to break
free. Aleera licks Anna's cheek.
                    ALEERA (CONT'D)
          I won't let the Master take you,
          Anna.

Aleera’s canines distend into horrible fangs, draining from
her beautiful face.
                    ALEERA (CONT'D)
          I want him all to myself.

Anna’s eyes widen, helpless in Aleera's grasp. And that's
when Dracula cuts in, he giver Aleera a smile.

                    DRACULA
          You look famished, my dear, go get
          yourself a bite.
                                                       80.



Aleera scowls as Dracula spins Anna over to a MIRROR WALL.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Don't we make a beautiful couple?

Anna looks at the mirror. Dracula is not in the reflection.
He starts to dance with her in front of the mirror.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          I'm looking for a new bride, Anna,
          someone strong and beautiful.

In the mirror it looks like Anna is dancing alone, seemingly
being dipped and spun and twirled by an invisible force.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          All it takes is one bite from me.

He hugs her tighter. Anna looks from his face to his chest,
crushed tightly against her breasts, her eyes widen.

                    ANNA
          You have no heartbeat.

                     DRACULA
          Perhaps it just needs to be
          rekindled.

Dracula leans in for a kiss. Anna angrily turns her head
away, so she doesn't see all the blood drain from Dracula’s
face and his canines distend into fangs, about to bite into
her neck.

A Fire Breather tilts his head safely up and away from the
crowd, lifts a torch to his mouth and starts to BLOW Carl
quickly sidles up and shoves him hard. The Fire Breather
BLOWS FLAMES across the back of Dracula's cape.

INT. BALLROOM - SECOND FLOOR -NIGHT

UP ON THE BALCONY: Van Helsing dashes down the HIGH WIRE. The
TIGHT ROPE WALKERS start to lose their balance.

INT. BALLROOM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
DOWN ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Dracula whirls around, ON FIRE,
shocked and angry.
                                                       81.



INT. BALLROOM - ABOVE DANCE FWOR-NIGHT
HIGH ABOVE THE DANCE FLOOR: Van Helsing curs a stay-wire,
grabs on and SWINGS DOWN into the crowd. The Tight Rope
Walkers ALL FALL.

!NT. BALLROOM - DANCE FLOOR- NIGHT DOWN ON THE DANCE FLOOR:

Dracula grabs the Fire Breather and tosses him dear across
the ballroom. Van Helsing swoops in, grabs Anna by her waist
and swings her up into the air.

INT. BALLROOM - BALCONY - NIGHT

UP ON THE BALCONY: Van Helsing and Anna land, skid to a stop
and look down.

The entire crowd looks up at our heroes. And then, in unison,
they all remove their masks. Their eyes go yellow, their skin
goes white, fangs glide out, they HISS angrily. They are all
VAMPIRES. Dracula smiles up at Van Helsing.

                    DRACULA
          Welcome to my summer palace.

A side door bursts open and a batch of vampires charge in
carrying Frankenstein over their heads, he's chained tight
and bellowing furiously. Igor stands on his chest.

                    IGOR
          We have him, Master! We have him!

Dracula gives an evil LAUGH, then looks at his followers and
gestures to Van Helsing and Anna.
                    DRACULA
          Enjoy yourselves!

The entire vampire crowd rushes forward, SHRIEKING like wild
Banshees.

Anna's response is to rip the arm off a SUIT OF ARMOR, stick
her hand down the sleeve and into its metal glove, attached
to the glove is an IRON MACE covered in spikes. Van Helsing's
response is to give her an incredulous look, then grab her
and yank her out of FRAME.

INT. BALLROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna race down a hallway.
                                                       82.



                    ANNA
          Where are we going!?

Van Helsing points to a huge STAINED GLASS WINDOW of angels,
cherubs, and saints.
                    VAN HELSING
          Through that window!
                    ANNA
          Are you out of your mind?! We'll be
          cut to ribbons!

                    VAN HELSING
          Not if you relax when you're going
          through it.

At the last second Van Helsing notices one of the SAINTS has
his hand out, as if to say "STOP." Van Helsing grabs Anna and
skids to a stop.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          My mistake, wrong window.

                    ANNA
          How do you know?
                    VAN HELSING
          Just a hunch.

He yanks her out of FRAME. Vampires bound past, chasing after
them. Dracula's LAUGH echoes throughout the palace.

INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY - NIGHT
Van Helsing and Anna race up some stairs and through a set of
double doors, vampires hot on their tail. They each grab a
door, slam it shut and bolt it tight. The vampires furiously
smash away from the other side. Van Helsing and Anna high-
tail it down the hall.

Carl comes scurrying around a corner at the far end of the
hallway. He sees Van Helsing and Anna running towards him and
holds up his LAVA CONTRAPTION.

                    CARL
          Now I know what it's for.

Carl is standing in front of another huge window.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Where are we going?
                                                         83.


                    VAN HELSING/ANNA
          Through that window!

Carl turns around to see the window they're talking about, he
pulls the pin on his contraption. Van Helsing and Anna each
grab one of Carl's arms, on the run, and yank him out through
the great glass window.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl crash through the shower of glass
and drop rwo stories down into a watery CATACOMB.

INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

The huge door disintegrates as the vampires crash through it.
They bound down the hallway. The contraption is sitting on
the floor, it pops open, rays of ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT stream
out. The vampires all melt screaming.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl burst to the surface inside a
large moldy catacomb filled with skulls and skeletons, the
huge EXPLOSION OF LIGHT finishing above them as pieces of
melted vampire splash down around them.

                    VAN HELSING
          Carl, you're a genius.
                     CARL
              (a bit freaked out)
          A genius with access to unstable
          chemicals.

Behind them, Igor YELLS commands in Hungarian as he and a
dozen of the porcine Dwergi ride a LONGBOAT down a ramp,
Frankenstein chained to the mast. Van Helsing immediately
heads for the longboat.

Igor and the Dwergi   drop their oars into the water and start
to row. Van Helsing   runs faster. Igor and the Dwergi paddle
out of a tunnel and   into the river. A huge grated GATE starts
to drop down behind   them. Igor pats Frankenstein on the head.

                    IGOR
          Say goodbye to your friends.
Frankenstein BELLOWS angrily. Igor cackles.
                                                          84.



                    IGOR (CONT'D)
          Because where we are taking you,
          only God and the devil know.

The metal gate SLAMS SHUT right in front of Van Helsing,
cutting him off from the river, he splashes up to it and
stares out through the grates. Frankenstein looks back at Van
Helsing. Frankenstein's hag-gard face a mask of helplessness
and hopelessness, looking forlorn and abandoned. Van Helsing
stares at him and grits his teeth in determination.

                    VAN HELSING
          I'll find you!... I'll get you back
          and set you free. I swear to god.

A huge DARK SHADOW swoops past, its talons scrape across the
metal grating, SPARKS FLY.

                    DRACULA (O.S.)
          God hasn't helped you in years, Van
          Helsing, why should he start now!?

We hear Aleera LAUGH as the two dark shadows flyaway. Anna
and Carl run up beside Van Helsing. Anna grabs him.

                    ANNA
          Come on, we've got to beat them
          back to Castle Frankenstein.

Van Helsing whirls around and starts to go.

                    VAN HELSING
          Yes, I've got to save that
          creature.
                    CARL (O.S.)
          Van Helsing!

Van Helsing turns back to Carl, who is till staring out
through the grate.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          I cabled Rome earlier, to apprise
          them of our situation.

Van Helsing gives Carl a suspicious look.

                    VAN HELSING
          And what did they say?

Carl turns to face him.
                                                       85.



                    CARL
          Even if you do somehow kill
          Dracula... Rome orders you to
          destroy Frankenstein as well.

Van Helsing's eyes darken, he starts to rev up.
                    VAN HELSING
          He isn't evil.

                    CARL
          Yes, but they said he isn't human
          either.

Van Helsing furiously closes in on Carl.

                    VAN HELSING
          Do they know him? Have they talked
          with him? Who are they to judge!?

                    CARL
          They want you to destroy him so he
          can never be used to harm humanity.

Van Helsing angrily grabs Carl by the throat and lifts him up
off his feet.

                    VAN HELSING
          And what of me? Did you tell them
          what I am to become? Did they tell
          you how to kill me? The correct
          angle of the stake as it enters my
          heart?! The exact measure of silver
          in each bullet!!

Van Helsing's voice has gotten incredibly deeper during this
speech, his eyes have gone dark red and he's strangling Carl.
Anna is already trying to rip the two men apart, but Van
Helsing's strength is too much for her. Carl gasps:

                    CARL
          No .... I ... I left you out.

Van Helsing snaps out of it and lets him go. Carl drops to
the ground, sucking air. Van Helsing stares down at him,
feeling terribly, then he looks at his shaking hands, a
whirlwind of emotions passing over his face, he clenches his
hands into fists, then exhales deeply and looks at Anna.
                    VAN HELSING
          It's starting.
                                                       86.



INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN LABORATORY - DAY

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl run into the laboratory. It's
empty, all of the lab equipment has been hurriedly removed.

                    VAN HELSING
          They must have taken all the
          equipment to Dracula's lair.

                    ANNA
          Then we've lost.

                    CARL
          Dracula cannot bring his children
          to life until the sun sets. We
          still have time.
                    ANNA
              (incredulous)
          "Time?" The sun sets in two hours,
          and we've been searching for him
          for more than four hundred years.

                    CARL
          I wasn't around for those four
          hundred years, now was I?

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - DAY

The rays of the mid-day sun are trying to pry their way
through the cloud-streaked sky over Manor Valerious. We can
hear Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl pounding up a staIrcase.
                    VAN HELSING (O.S.)
          So what did you learn?

INT. TOWER BEDROOM - DAY

Our heroes enter the tower bedroom where they come upon the
mass of relics, artifacts, and texts.

                    CARL
          That Count Dracula was actually the
          son of Valerio us the Elder.

Carl looks at Anna.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          The son of you're ancestor.

Anna just shrugs, no big deal.
                                                          87.



                    ANNA
          Everybody knows that, what else?
                    CARL
          Oh, uh, right. Well, it all started
          in 1462, when Dracula was murdered.

                    VAN HELSING
          Does it say who murdered him?

                    CARL
          No, just some vague reference to
          the Left Hand of God.

Van Helsing looks intrigued. Carl opens the elaborately
inscribed SACRED LATIN TEXT.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          Anyway, according to this when
          Dracula died he made a covenant
          with the devil.

Van Helsing and Anna jump in, guessing.

                    VAN HELSING
          And was given a new life.

                    ANNA
          But the only way to sustain that
          life was by drinking the blood of
          others.
                     CARL
              (annoyed)
          Are you two going to let me tell
          the story?
                    VAN HELSING/ANNA
          Sorry. Sorry.

                    CARL
          Your ancestor, having sired this
          evil creature, went to Rome to seek
          forgiveness from God, that's when
          the bargain was made, Valerious the
          Elder was to kill Dracula in return
          for the eternal salvation of his
          entire family, right down the line
          all the way to you.

He points to Anna. Anna nods in understanding.
                                                       88.



                    ANNA
          But he couldn't do it. As evil as
          Dracula was, my ancestor could not
          kill his own son.

Carl points at some of the fantastical engravings on the
relics and artifacts, helping tell the story:

                    CARL
          So he banished Dracula to an icy
          fortress, sending him through a
          door from which there was no
          return.

                    ANNA
          And then the devil gave him wings.
                    CARL
          Yes.

                    VAN HELSING
          All right, so where is this door?

                    CARL
          I don't know, but when the old
          knight couldn't kill his son, he
          left clues, so that future
          generations might do it for him.

                    ANNA
          That must be what my father was
          looking for in here, clues to the
          door's location.

An idea suddenly springs into Van Helsing's head.

                    VAN HELSING
          The door... The door... of course!

He turns and races out of the room. Anna and Carl exchange a
look, then haul-ass after Van Helsing.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

Van Helsing runs up to the massive £loor-to-ceiling OIL
PAINTING of Transylvania. Anna and Carl right behind him.

                    VAN HELSING
          You said your father spent hours
          staring at this painting, trying to
          find Dracula's lair, I think you
          were right, quite literally.
                                                         89.



Van Helsing checks where the frame meets the wall, but the
frame is actually molded into the wall.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          I think this is the door. He just
          didn't know how to open it.

Carl points to a LATIN INSCRIPTION on the painting.

                    CARL
          Look! A Latin inscription. Maybe it
          works like that painting in the
          tower.

Carl starts mumbling the inscription in Latin. Anna steps up
to Van Helsing

                    ANNA
          If this was a door, my father would
          have opened it long ago.

Carl shoves a chair aside, revealing a missing piece of the
painting.

                    CARL
          I can't finish the inscription.
          There's a piece missing.

                    VAN HELSING
          Your father didn't have this.

Van Helsing pulls out the torn piece of painted cloth.

                    ANNA
          Where did you get that?

Van Helsing hands the painted piece of cloth to Carl.
                       VAN HELSING
          Finish it.

Carl places it inside the missing piece of the map. The torn
piece is a perfect match. Carl finishes the inscription.

                    CARL
          Deum lacessat ac ianuam imbeat
          apenn.

                    VAN HELSING
          In the name of God, open this door.
                                                          90.



And that's when the painting begins to change, starting at
the frame line and spreading inward, a THICK CRYSTAL FROST
washes over the painting, eating it up until the painting has
completely dissolved, leaving an ANCIENT MIRROR in its place.

                       CARL
          A mirror?

Anna stares at it, thinking hard.
                    ANNA
          Dracula has no reflection in a
          mirror.
                       VAN HELSING
          Why?

                    CARL
          Maybe ... maybe to Dracula, it's
          not a mirror at all.

Van Helsing reaches out to touch the mirror, his hand goes
straight through it, vanishing inside it, he inhales sharply.
Carl Jumps.
                    CARL/ANNA
          What? What?!
                       VAN HELSING
          It's cold.

He pulls his hand out to reveal SNOWFLAKES in his palm.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          And it's snowing.
Van Helsing grabs a TORCH out of a sconce on the wall, and
prepares to step through.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          See you on the other side.

                    CARL
          Don't worry, we're behind you ...
          not right behind you, but behind
          you.

Anna grabs his arm.

                    ANNA
          Be careful.
                                                       91.



Van Helsing gives her a nod, then steps straight through the
mirror, vanishing inside it.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - DUSK

Van Helsing steps out of another ancient mirror, encased in a
huge black OBELISK. It's snowing. A beat later, Anna steps
through. They both look up. Chiselled out of a massive rock
mountain is an enormous cathedral-like fortress; spires,
turrets, gargoyles, the works. Covered in permafrost. Icicles
everywhere. Carelessly flung hither and yon are human
skeletons. Something very evil lives here. THUNDER RUMBLES.

                    ANNA
          Castle Dracula.

They look back at the mirror. Carl is nowhere in sight. They
head for the castle. Behind them, Carl slowly seeps out of
the mirror, eyes closed, he opens them to see the forbidding
fortress. The sheer enormity of it terrifies him. He spins
around and runs back into the mirror-wham! Face first,
bounces off and lands on his ass. The mirror is a one-way
ticket. Carl leaps up and scurries after them.
                     CARL
          Wait up!

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT

They arrive at a massive door at the front of the ancient
fortress, made of iron, rusted shut, covered in slippery ice.
There's a TRANSOM at the top of it, but it's thirty feet up.

                    CARL
          Do we have a plan? It doesn't have
          to be Wellington's at Waterloo, but
          some sort of plan would be nice.

                    VAN HELSING
          We're going to go in there and stop
          Dracula.

                    ANNA
          And kill anything that gets in our
          way.

Carl starts to back away.

                    CARL
          Let me know how that goes.

Van Helsing grabs Carl and Anna by their collars and runs
straight up, thirty feet, they go right through the transom.
                                                       92.



INT. CASTLE DRACULA ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

The three of them land softly on the floor on the other side.
Anna and Carl are shocked, they turn and look at Van Helsing.

                    CARL
          Well, as grateful as I am to be out
          of the cold, that doesn't seem like
          a good thing.

Anna looks at Van Helsing, bent over in pain, his face and
eyes ate distorted into a vague resemblance of a wolf, and
then it passes. They share a look.

Then he moves forward, a man on a mission. The whole place is
a massive frozen foyer, and all of the incredibly high walls,
pillars, and ceilings are covered in gooey COCOONS. Thousands
of them. With electric wires sticking out of all of them.

                    ANNA
          Oh my god, if he brings all of
          these to life ...

                    CARL
          ... the world would be a
          smorgasbord.

And that's when Igor comes scurrying around a comer, a bundle
of wires and electrodes in his hands, he skids to a stop,
looking stunned as he sees Van Helsing.

                    IGOR
          How? How did you? ... It's
          impossible.

He quickly recovers his senses, drops everything and runs
like hell. Van Helsing pumps one of the saw blades into his
palm and throws it, it whistles through the air, catches Igor
by his sleeve, and pins him to a rock wall.

                    IGOR (CONT'D)
          Please! Please don't kill me!

Van Helsing strides forward.
                    VAN HELSING
          Why?

                    IGOR
          Well, urn, I ...

He can't think of a good reason. Van Helsing rips the blade
out of the wall, about to kill him.
                                                       93.


And then they hear Frankenstein BELLOW Somewhere nearby. They
look around. Right next to Igor is a window with metal bars.
Van Helsing sees something moving inside it. It's a PULLEY
with chains. He sticks his torch through the bars and looks
down a SHAFT.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - DUNGEON -NIGHT

Frankenstein is in a DUNGEON CELL encased in a huge BLOCK OF
ICE, only his head and neck stick out, chains run through the
block and attach up to the pulley. The shaft rises another
thirty floors. From the top of the shaft a VOICE rings out:

                    DRACULA (O.S.)
          Bring me the monster...!!

Dracula's voice ECHOES through the immense fortress as Igor
snickers evilly.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ENTRANCE HALLWAY - DUSK

                    IGOR
          My Master has awakened.

The pulley starts to rise. The chains snap taut. Frankenstein
and the block of ice quickly lift up off the cell floor.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ENTRANCE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Van Helsing drops the torch and goes nuts, furiously yanking
and pulling on the thick bars with incredible strength, they
actually start to twist, but they're never going to give,
even with the semi-insane look which has crept into his eyes.
Anna tries to help, to no avail.

The block of ice continues its rise. Van Helsing collapses
against the bars, the insane look seeps away, he's back to
himself once again. Frankenstein comes eye-to-eye with him.
The two beings look at each other, a real connection between
the two of them. The look on Frankenstein's face softens.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
          There is a cure.

Van Helsing is shocked.
                    VAN HELSING
          What?

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Dracula, he has the cure, to remove
          the curse of the Werewolf.
                                                       94.



Frankenstein continues up the shaft. Van Helsing desperately
tries to stick his head through the bars, gaining one last
look up at Frankenstein as he's hauled up.

                    FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Go! Find the cure! Save yourself!

Anna grabs Van Helsing and pulls him back.

                    ANNA
          Come on! You heard him! Let's find
          it.

Van Helsing looks at her, thinking hard.

                    VAN HELSING
          Why does Dracula have a cure?

                    ANNA
          I don't care.

                    VAN HELSING
          I do. Why would he need one?

Van Helsing looks at Igor. Igor clamps his mouth shut. The
CAMERA does a dramatic PUSH IN on Carl as his face fills with
a dawning realization:

                    CARL
          Because the only thing that can
          kill him ... is a werewolf.

Van Helsing and Anna look at Carl. Carl smiles.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          The painting. That's what it meant.

                    ANNA
          But Dracula has used werewolves to
          do his biding for centuries.

                    CARL
          Yes, but if one ever had the will
          to turn on him, he'd need a cure to
          remove the curse and make it human
          before it bit him.

The realization of this crashes down on them. Van Helsing
turns to Igor and gestures to Anna and Carl.

                    VAN HELSING
          You're going to take these two and
          lead them to it.
                                                       95.



                    IGOR
          No I'm not.

Van Helsing sticks the blade under Igor's chin. Igor smiles.
                      IGOR (CONT'D)
          Yes I am.

Carl steps up.

                    CARL
          When the bell begins to roll
          midnight, you'll be able to kill
          Dracula, we just have to find the
          cure and get it into you before the
          final stroke.

Van Helsing pulls a small but extremely nasty-looking WEAPON
out of his cloak. It looks like nail clippers designed by the
Spanish Inquisition. He holds it up in front of Igor's face.

                    VAN HELSING
          If they even suspect you're
          misleading them ...

He hands the weapon to Anna.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          ... clip off one of his fingers.

                    ANNA
          My pleasure.

Igor looks terrified, he gestures to the set of staircases.

                    IGOR
          The stairs on the right, they lead
          to the black tower, that's where it
          is.

                    VAN HELSING
          And the stairs on the left?

Igor hesitates. Van Helsing reaches for the "clippers. "

                    IGOR
          The Devil's tower! Devil's tower!
          That's where we reassembled the
          laboratory. Would I lie to you?
                    VAN HELSING
          Not if you wanted to live.
                                                          96.



Van Helsing turns to Carl.

                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          If I'm not "cured" by the twelfth
          stroke of midnight ...

He pulls a metal tube out of his cloak, naps out into a
SILVER STAKE, and hands it to Carl. Carl's eyes widen.

                    CARL
          I don't think I could.
                      VAN HELSING
          You must.

Carl nods, takes the stake, shares a look with Van Helsing,
and then grabs Igor by the scruff of his neck and pulls him
off towards the staircases.
                      CARL
          Come on.

Van Helsing and Anna look into each other's eyes, both of
them scared, both of them gearing up. Van Helsing has never
been so concerned for another human being in his life.
                    VAN HELSING
          Don't get killed.

Anna has never been so filled with conviction in her life.

                    ANNA
          You still don't understand. It
          doesn't matter what happens to me.
          We must save my family.

She starts to go. Van Helsing pulls her back.

                    VAN HELSING
          If you're late ... run like hell.

She nods and starts to go. Van Helsing Pulls her back again.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          Don't be late.

She smiles and starts to go. Van Helsing pulls her back
again, and then kisses her hard. She gives it right back to
him, a real bodice ripper, she pulls herself away, stares
deep into his smoldering eyes, then runs off after Carl.
                                                       97.



INT. LABORATORY TOWER - NIGHT

The Dwergi are putting the final touches em the reassembly of
Victor Frankenstein's equipment. Frankenstein himself is now
welded into the iron pod, bellowing angrily. Dracula strides
past, slamming all of the huge electrical switches on.

                    DRACULA
          What ate you complaining about?

The entire laboratory sparks to life. Spectacular arcs of
electricity shoot up and down the walls between the dynamos.
The gears kick in. The fan belts snap taut and start to spin.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          This is why you were made, to prove
          that god is not the only one who
          can create life!

Dracula turns the flywheel. Frankenstein begins to rise.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          And now you will give that life to
          my young.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - RIGHT TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT

Van Helsing comes up the spiraling stone staircase and sees a
large gash in the rock wall.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - SHAFT -NIGHT

Van Helsing steps inside and sees CHAINS jangling in the
middle of the dark shaft, he looks down at the fifteen-story
drop. And then he jumps. He grabs the chains, swings wildly,
dangling precariously, some of his weapons drop out of his
cloak and fall. And then, with superhuman strength, agility
and speed, Van Helsing starts to climb the chains.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Igor leads Anna and Carl up the stairs to a landing with an
arched doorway, the entrance to the Antidote Tower.
                    IGOR
          There it is.

Inside the large room is a pedestal. On the pedestal is a
GLASS JAR filled with a clear jelly-like goo, suspended in
the goo is a SYRINGE. Igor starts to enter. Anna grabs him
and holds him back.
                                                       98.



                    ANNA
          I'll go first.

Igor gives her a nasty look. Anna gives it back to him, then
enters the tower, eyes on the alert, heading for the syringe.
All the windows are barred shut. There is no other entrance.

Carl watches her, his eyes momentarily off Igor. Igor uses
the moment, takes a quick step back, and with the heel of his
boot, kicks Carl in the ass. Anna spins around in time to see
Carl sprawl into the room. Igor cackles gleefully.

                    IGOR
          Stay as long as you like.

He pulls a lever on the wall, a grated metal gate crashes
down, locking Anna and Carl inside the tower. Igor scurries
away laughing.
                     IGOR (CONT'D)
          Bye-bye!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

All of the equipment is accelerating wildly.

The Dwergi are desperately trying to keep everything from
spinning out of control. Dracula is in rapture as sparks rain
down upon him.

Van Helsing climbs up out of the shaft and hides behind the
shattered block of ice, which is being pelted and melted by
raining sparks. Dynamos crackle. Pulleys whirl. Electrical
arcs flash. Van Helsing looks up. Sixty feet above him is an
OPEN SKYLIGHT, twenty feet above that is the POD apparatus.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - SKYLIGHT -NIGHT

Frankenstein struggles in the pod as LIGHTNING FLASHES across
the sky above him.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna and Carl are staring at the syringe inside the jar of
vile goo.

                    ANNA
          Go ahead, grab it.
                                                         99.



                    CARL
          You go ahead and grab it. If
          there's one thing I've learned,
          it's never be the first one to
          stick your hand into a viscous
          material.

A hideous FACE lowers down right behind them. It's Aleera.
                       ALEERA
          Smart boy.

Carl practically jumps out of his skin. Anna grabs Carl and
jerks him back behind the huge jar. Aleera drops down with a
smile.
                    ALEERA (CONT'D)
          Did I scare you?
                      CARL
                (terrified)
          No.

                    ALEERA
          Then maybe I need to try a little
          harder.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Van Helsing starts to climb STRAIGHT UP THE SHEER WALL.
Grasping for purchase in the grouting. Only someone with
superhuman strength in their fingertips could do this.

A Dwerger on scaffolding turns around and comes face-to-face
with Van Helsing, clinging to the wall like a fly. The
Dwerger's goggles are up and we get our first glimpse of the
hideous Dwergi eyes. Before the Dwerger can even scream, Van
Helsing grabs him with one hand, slams him off the rock wall,
then chucks him into the dark recesses of the laboratory.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna suddenly lashes out with her sword and knocks over the
jar. It crashes to the floor, splattering some goo on Aleera.
The vile goo burns like acid into her and right through the
stone floor. Aleera HOWLS in pain and rage. Carl freaks.

                    CARL
          See! What did I tell you!?

Anna gestures to the syringe rolling across the floor.
                                                      100.



                    ANNA
          Grab it! Grab it! Grab it!

Using the hem of his frock, Carl scoops up the syringe, it
burns and smokes and he jumps and yelps, but he still manages
to hold onto it. In the meantime, Anna has grabbed a piece of
the glass and scooped up some of the goo. She runs and flings
it at the bars of the gate. A hole melts through the bars.
                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          C'mon!

Carl races to the hole, the syringe smoking-up his frock.
Anna shoves Carl out first.
                    ANNA (CONT'D)
          Go! Go! Go!

Carl races off down the hall. Before Anna can get out, a hand
grabs her and spins her around. It's Aleera. The burns on her
face HEAL.

                    ALEERA
          You can't go until I say you can
          go.
                    ANNA
          KEEP RUNNING CARL!

                    ALEERA
          And I'll say you can go when you're
          dead.

Aleera grabs Anna and throws her across the floor. Anna skids
across the room, her sabre goes flying.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - SKYLIGHT -NIGHT

Up on the pod Van Helsing comes eye-to-eye with Frankenstein.
The WIND whips at them. LIGHTNING FLASHES. THUNDER ROARS. Van
Helsing grabs one of the three metal straps welded onto the
bolts riveted down Frankenstein's chest.

                    VAN HELSING
          This is going to hurt.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
              (grits his teeth)
          I am accustomed to pain.

Van Helsing nods, bad-to-the-bone.
                                                      101.



                    VAN HELSING
          Lets you know you're alive.

With his new strength, Van Helsing rips the first metal strap
off. Frankenstein grimaces in pain. And that's when a BOLT OF
LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod. Van Helsing is
catapulted into the air. Frankenstein roars in pain.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula looks up as a BLAST OF ENERGY emanates from the pod
down into the room and through the equipment, which instantly
OVERLOADS, spitting FLAMES and SPARKS. One of the Dwergi is
blown across the room, ON FIRE. Dracula smiles maniacally.
                    DRACULA
          Give me LIFE!!!

The blast of energy surges out through every door, crack, and
pore of the room.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

The energy blast envelops the entrance hall washing over all
the cocoons, which begin to UNDULATE with life.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing dangles from the edge of the tower, it's a sixty
floor drop to an icy canyon below, electrical wires crackle
and spit all around him. He starts to claw his way back up.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna staggers to her feet as Aleera strides towards her. Anna
grabs a torch off the wall and lunges at Aleera's face.
Aleera just blows it out. Anna quickly backs away. Aleera
smiles, then one by one she blows out all of the torches in
the room until the place goes PITCH BLACK.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The weather has gone insane. Thunder, lightning, rain and
wind whip down around Cart as he runs out, onto an enormous
ancient STONE BRIDGE that connects the two towers. It's
covered in huge potholes and barbed rubble. A LIGHTNING
STRIKE hits one of the stone pilasters on the bridge. It's
going to be a very difficult six hundred yard dash.

And that's when Igor runs out with his cattle prod. Carl jags
out of the way as the prod slams into the railing right next
to him, just missing him, spitting sparks.
                                                        102.



EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing rips the second metal strap off of Frankenstein.
Frankenstein grimaces in pain, then he sees something coming.
                      FRANKENSTEIN
          Look out!

Van Helsing throws himself to the floor of the apparatus as
once again LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod.
Frankenstein roars in pain.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Another energy blast surges through the room. Dracula lifts
his arms and eyes to the sky in triumph.

                    DRACULA
          One more bolt and my young shall
          live!

And then he sees Van Helsing high above him. Dracula scowls
and TRANSFORMS into a HIDEOUS WINGED BEAST FROM HELL.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Pitch black. And then a lightning strike illuminates Anna,
groping her way around the room, WE RACK FOCUS to see Aleera
hanging upside down from the ceiling twenty feet behind her.

WE PUSH IN ON Aleera's gleaming face. And then go to her POV:
Aleera can see perfectly in the dark. She watches as Anna
gropes her way across the dark wall, heading for the gate.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

SPARKS explode off the tip   of the cattle prod as it slams
into a pilaster right next   to Carl's head. Carl takes off
running across the ancient   bridge towards the distant tower.
Igor chases after him with   the sparking prod.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing rips the last metal strap off of Frankenstein.
And that's when the hideous Winged Dracula Beast swoops up
and rips into Van Helsing, throwing him back. Van Helsing
bounces off the apparatus and drops-

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

-sixty feet down through the room, crashing through the
equipment on his way. SPARKS FLY. FLAMES BLOW Dwergi run.
                                                      103.



EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Frankenstein stands up, dazed, about to step out of the pod.
Another BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the conductor. It lights
Frankenstein up like a Christmas tree and catapults him
through the air. An energy blast surges down into the lab.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

And washes over the cocoons. The cocoons begin to EXPLODE.
Hundreds and hundreds of the hideous pygmy bats burst out and
swarm around the great hall.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna makes it to the gate. Lightning flashes, revealing
Aleera standing on the other side of it, she punches Anna
across the room. Anna slams into a wall and drops like a sack
of potatoes, out cold.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Frankenstein clings to the edge of the tower, struggling to
hold on as electrical wires spark and spit all around him. He
loses his grip and starts to drop. It's sixty stories down.
He manages to grab a wire, which snaps loose and swings him
down and across the castle, his legs kicking wildly.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl runs like mad, weaving and bobbing as Igor tries to nail
him with the cattle prod. Carl suddenly sees Frankenstein
swinging on a wire, coming right at him. Carl dives to the
ground as the wire whips over his head. The wire catches Igor
across the chest and launches him out over the railing. The
wire then catches on a pilaster whipping Frankenstein into
the bridge. Igor drops past him, screaming in terror on his
long journey down to the icy valley below.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna groggily rolls over on the floor. Aleera steps up over
her, then grabs her and lifts her up while TRANSFORMING into
a huge winged bat.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Battered and bloody, Van Helsing staggers through the burning
equipment, looking delirious.
                                                       104.



EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl looks over the railing. Sees Frankenstein hanging by the
wire, dangling sixty stories up, losing his grip, sliding
down the last five feet of the wire, now four feet, now three
feet, two feet, one. He looks up at Carl.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
          Help ... me.

Carl is emotionally torn.

                    CARL
          You're supposed to die.

Frankenstein grimaces, desperately clinging to life.
                    FRANKENSTEIN
          I want to live.

Carl makes his decision.

                    CARL
          All right! All right! Hold on! Hold
          on!

Carl sticks the syringe between his teeth, grabs the
connector wire and pulls with all his might.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna can barely move, choking from the incredible grip Aleera
has on her throat. Aleera's hideous face smiles.

                    ALEERA
          Be happy in the knowledge that I
          shall weep over your dead body.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl gives one last tug. The wire breaks loose from the
pilaster. Frankenstein swings away from the bridge and arcs
up towards a barred window on the side of the Antidote Tower.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Aleera's fangs distend, she leans into bite Anna's neck. And
that's when Frankenstein crashes through the barred window
and slams into them. Anna is knocked free.
                                                         105.



INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The huge Winged Beast strides through the flames, then
TRANSFORMS back into Dracula, a smile on his lips.

                    DRACULA
          You're too late, my friend! My
          live!

Van Helsing backs away, really mess

                    VAN HELSING
          Then the only way to kill them ...

He looks out through a window at the CLOCK TOWER.
                    VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
          ... is to kill you.

A look of pure confidence fills Dracula's face.
                    DRACULA
          That is correct.

A deranged look fills Van Helsing's face.
                       VAN HELSING
          So be it.

EXT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna looks back into the tower. Aleera lunges at her, but
Frankenstein grabs her. Anna starts to head back to help
Frankenstein.

                    FRANKENSTEIN
          No! Go help Van Helsing.

Frankenstein throws Aleera across the room, then looks at
Anna.
                       FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Now!

Anna looks him in the eyes.
                       ANNA
          Thank you.

Frankenstein nods and turns back to Aleera, who flies across
the room and tackles him. Anna scrambles back out the window.
                                                      106.



EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

A bolt of lightning suddenly rips a huge GAPING HOLE out of
the bridge near Carl, blocking him from continuing forward.
It's a twenty-foot leap or a sixty-story drop. He looks back
and sees Anna crawling out of the smashed window.

                    CARL
          Anna! I need some help!

Anna clings to the wind-whipped wall, trying not to get blown
into the precipice.

                    ANNA
          Now is not a good time, Carl!!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

As Dracula moves in on Van Helsing,

Van Helsing looks out a window to the CLOCK-TOWER. The BIG
HAND slams forward. It is now exactly one minute to midnight.
The clock CHIMES. Van Helsing's whole body suddenly
CONVULSES. Insanity pours into his eyes. Dracula looks
perplexed. Van Helsing GROANS:
                    VAN HELSING
          One.

Van Helsing TRANSFORMS into the biggest, sexiest, most bad-
assed Werewolf ever. Dracula looks stunned.

                    DRACULA
          No .... This ... this is not right
              (furious)
          This can not be!

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl looks from the clock tower to Anna.
                    CARL
          Hurry!

Anna leaps out and grabs the same electrical wire that
Frankenstein used. The wire HISSES and SPARKS as Anna is
swung down across the castle. The CLOCK CHIMES.
                    ANNA
          Two!
                                                      107.



INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula cautiously backs off as the huge Werewolf collects
itself and moves towards him. For the first time in his long
life, Dracula actually looks nervous, he plays for time.

                    DRACULA
          You and I are part of the same
          grand game, Gabriel. But we need
          not find ourselves on opposite
          sides of the board.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Carl steps up to the edge of the bridge,
he's going to throw Anna the syringe.
                    CARL
          Three!

Anna switches wires in mid-air as she rockets across the
castle. Carl aims and throws the syringe. Anna grabs it! Then
arcs up towards the Laboratory Tower.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The Werewolf LUNGES at Dracula. Dracula whirls around,
becoming the Winged Beast, he flies up the wall, heading for
the open skylight. The Werewolf bounds after him, ripping its
way straight up the sheer rock, it leaps out and grabs the
Winged Beast. Both creatures crash down into the equipment.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES as Anna arcs up towards the Laboratory
Tower. And that's when Aleera swoops down and cuts the wire.
Anna is thrown off. She crashes onto a ledge of the tower.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula leaps up first and backs away.

                    DRACULA
          You're being used Gabriel. As was
          I. But I escaped, and so can you!

The Werewolf springs at Dracula. Dracula becomes the Winged
Beast and desperately uses his four razor sharp appendages to
claw at the Werewolf. The Werewolf howls in pain, then lashes
out and rips away at the Beast. The Beast shrieks, then
throws itself up into the rafters and becomes Dracula, his
arm is torn and limp. The clock CHIMES.
                                                        108.



                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          I know who you are. Who controls
          you. Join me! Join me and I'll cut
          the strings that play you! I'll
          give you your life back!



EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Anna clambers up onto a ledge just as Aleera lands next to
her. Anna starts backing up the precarious perch as Aleera
closes in. WE PAN UP to the FULL MOON and see CLOUDS ABOUT TO
OBSCURE IT.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The Werewolf looks insanely hungry as it closes in on
Dracula, who is desperately backing away.

                    DRACULA
          Don't you understand!? Four hundred
          years ago we were friends.
          Partners! Brothers!

The clock CHIMES. The Werewolf leaps at him. Dracula becomes
the Beast and desperately tries to flyaway, but he's too
damaged. The Werewolf grabs him by the throat, about to kill
him, and that's when the Werewolf turns back into Van
Helsing. Van Helsing quickly staggers back. Dracula looks out
at the roiling clouds obscuring the moon, then he looks at
Van Helsing. That old confident glint fills Dracula's eyes.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Did I mention that it was you who
          murdered me?

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Anna backs up against a wall on the ledge,
trapped. Aleera steps in for the kill.

                    ALEERA
          Your blood shall make me even more
          beautiful. What do you think of
          that?

A SILVER STAKE suddenly impales her through the chest. Aleera
shrieks. Anna looks over at the bridge, to where Carl has
crawled down between the girders, then she looks back at
Aleera, who is staring at her in horror and starting to rot.
                                                         109.



                    ANNA
          I think if you're going to kill
          somebody, kill them, don't stand
          around talking about it.

Aleera bursts into rot, the silver stake is flung into a beam
right next to Carl's head. The clock CHIMES. Carl looks up at
the clock.

                    CARL
          How many is that? How many is
          that!?

Anna is already racing up the parapet.
                    ANNA
          Eight!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Van Helsing desperately backs off through the FLAMING,
SPARKING equipment as Dracula slowly moves in on him.

                    DRACULA
          All I wanted was life, Gabriel ...
          now I'll have to take yours.

Dracula holds up his left hand, his ring finger has long ago
been CUT OFF.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          And I'll take my ring back as well.

The clock CHIMES. Van Helsing backs up into a wall, trapped,
breathing hard, the two men stare at each other. Dracula's
bicuspids distend into long fangs.

                    DRACULA (CONT'D)
          Don't be afraid, Gabriel, now I
          will give you back your life, your
          memory.

And then through a window, Van Helsing sees the clouds about
to fully reveal the full moon. The clock CHIMES.

                     VAN HELSING
          Some things are best left
          forgotten.

Van Helsing becomes the Werewolf. He lunges, grabs Dracula
and CHOMPS into his throat. Dracula CRIES OUT in agony.
                                                      110.



Dracula starts shriveling and decaying and wasting away until
there is nothing left but charred remains burning into the
floor. The clock CHIMES.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

All of the pygmy bats shriek in horror and then explode into
black goo.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna bursts into the room and races at the Werewolf's back,
syringe in hand, ready to stab him. The clock CHIMES.
                      ANNA
          Twelve.

The Werewolf spins around and sees Anna coming. He POUNCES.
FANGS and CLAWS. Anna SCREAMS. The Werewolf tackles Anna.
They crash down onto a couch. Carl runs in and skids to a
stop, the Werewolf's back is to him, but he can see that it's
alive and on top of Anna.
                      CARL
          Midnight.

Carl is devastated. He lifts up the silver stake.
                    CARL (CONT'D)
          God forgive me.

He runs forward and swings the stake down at the Werewolf's
back. At the last millisecond the Werewolf spins around and
grabs Carl's wrist, stopping him short. Carl is terrified, he
stares at the Werewolf. The Werewolf stares back, then turns
slightly to reveal the SYRINGE sticking out of its chest,
empty. The Werewolf lets go of Carl. Carl stumbles back. The
Werewolf rips the empty syringe out of its chest, throws it
away, then looks down at Anna. Her eyes are wide open.
                    CARL (CONT'D)
          She's dead.

And then WE CUT TO one of the most iconographic SHOTS in the
whole movie: the FULL MOON shines in through an arched stone
window, which frames the Werewolf, who is crouched over our
gorgeous heroine, sprawled dead across a broken couch.

WE SLOWLY PUSH IN as the Werewolf tilts its head back and
BAYS AT THE MOON, a long, mournful HOWL, it slowly TRANSFORMS
back into Van Helsing, CRYING OUT at the moon in anguish....
                                                      111.



EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAWN

Carl READS from the Bible, tears on his cheeks. Van Helsing,
carrying a torch, steps up to a funeral pyre. He stares down
at Anna, lying on the pyre, looking beautiful. WE CUT WIDE to
see that they ate on a bluff overlooking the SEA.

EXT. SEA - DAWN

A dark figure paddles a makeshift raft out to sea. It's
Frankenstein. He looks back up to the bluff to see the
flaming pyre IGNITE. Frankenstein doffs his hat in respect,
sighs heavily, then turns back around and continues paddling.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT

The glow from the flames flickers off Van Helsing's sad face
as he stares down at the ground. Carl still reading.

The SMOKE from the funeral pyre suddenly FORMS A PICTURE OF
ANNA'S FACE. Tendrils of smoke waft out, like long smoky
fingers they touch Van Helsing's chin and lift it up. Van
Helsing sees her. Anna smiles. Then her face starts to float
up into the dawn sky along with the rest of the smoke.

Van Helsing is shocked, he staggers forward, as if to follow.

Anna's face is suddenly surrounded by the vague faces of her
mother, her father, her brother Velkan, and many other
welcoming family members. Her father gives her a hug. Her
mother starts to comb her hair.

Carl smiles as he steps up and puts his hand on Van Helsing's
shoulder.

Anna gives Van Helsing one last look, her radiant eyes
beaming with happiness, and then she and all of her family
start to ascend into the glowing dawn sky.

Van Helsing stares upward, devastated.

And then in one final glorious moment, Anna and her family
swoop up into the sky and blend with the fading stars.

WE PUSH IN on Van Helsing's face as the look in his eyes
changes, from devastated loss, to a gentle look of peace. We
can see that he is truly happy for Anna ....
                                             DISSOLVE TO:
                                                      112.



EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAWN

Van Helsing and Carl riding two black stallions across an
endless golden wheat field, heading off into a new dawn.
                                                FADE OUT.


                           THE END
